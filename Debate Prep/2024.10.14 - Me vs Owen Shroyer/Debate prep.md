Kamala Harris is the better leader for our country, and moving past Trump will allow the conservatives to close this dark chapter and go back to being a real political party in this country.

“MAGA Republicans have made their choice.  They embrace anger.  They thrive on chaos.  They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.  
   
But together — together, we can choose a different path.  We can choose a better path.  Forward, to the future.  A future of possibility.  A future to build and dream and hope.”



### Trump is a bad Christian
Trump is arguably working on his third divorce and has engaged in infidelity across all three of his relationships. Trump’s first marriage with Ivana blew up when he brought his mistress, Marla Maples, to a family vacation where she confronted his wife. After Ivana divorced him, Trump started dating her, then he admitted to cheating on her with 3 other women, at least. They divorced in 1999. Trump then married Melania, whom he has cheated on with at least Stormy Daniels. Worst of all, he did this during a celebrity golf tournament in July of 2006 while Melania was at home taking care of their fourth month old son, Barron.

When asked if he ever had to ask God for forgiveness, Trump said no.

When asked, Trump [cannot name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERUngQUCsyE) a single Bible verse or say if he prefers one Testament over the other. It’s unclear if he has ever stepped foot inside a church in his life
### Trump tried to steal the election
To this day, Trump and Vance still will not acknowledge Trump’s defeat in 2020. Trump hired private legal counsel, insane people, as he himself has said according to court filings, to try and steal the election on January 6th in the Congress. They lied about voter fraud, they lied about the evidence they had for it, they lied about their court cases, they lied about everything and used it to get people like Owen to cheerlead others to march on the Capitol to use violence to delay the certification of the vote, which they were successful in doing. It was only because people like Pence, Barr and other principled conservatives stood in their way.
### Trump Doesn’t Care about Democracy
After fabricating claims of voter fraud, Trump took to Truth Social and said he would terminate the Constitution. Who else has said anything like this? Trump said he would also be a dictator for his first day in office.
- Donald Trump on Democracy
	- Dec 2022 - "[So, with the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION in working closely with Big Tech Companies, the DNC, & the Democrat Party, do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great “Founders” did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109449803240069864)"
	- Dec 2023 - Trump says he'll be a [dictator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQkrWL7YuGk) for his first day.

Kamala won her election for DA in San Francisco, she won two elections in California for Attorney General. Kamala called for an end to the violence from BLM, whereas Trump will never acknowledge the violence he encouraged on January 6th. Conservatives are upset that Kamala donated to a bail fund, but excuse Trump outright pardoning all of his criminal friends.
### Every accusation is a confession
The largest victim of MAGA over the past 8 years has been the truth. Trump and his ilk lie as easily as they breathe. Every single accusation against the Democrats is a confession to their own behavior.

The Twitter files told us that there was ZERO pressure from the FBI to silence the the Hunter Biden laptop story. Direct links, not the discussion of, but only direct links to the hacked material was only disallowed for 24 hours before Twitter reverse-coursed. For the JD Vance leaks, those remain banned to this very day, all without a peep from the conservative side.

Conservatives claim Biden was blocking aid to states, but the governors of Florida, Georgia, South and North Carolina, Ron Desantis, Brian Kemp, Henry McMaster and Roy Cooper have ALL said that Biden gave them everything he could provide. It was Trump who delayed aid going to California due to political differences, Trump who only granted North Carolina 1% of what they asked for in 2017 for hurricane relief and Trump who, just a few days ago, threatened to withhold aid from states who didn’t play ball, politically.

They said they wouldn’t take the experimental vaccines, offered freely, but had no problem obsessing over monoclonal antibodies, which cost thousands of dollars at the time.

On January 6th, they called the rioters patriots, and sons of the second American revolution. On the 7th, they called them Antifa.

With zero evidence, they alleged widespread voter fraud across the entire US. They showed none, were proven to have lied about everything.
- Election in 2020 was stolen but Tina Peters was just convicted for 9 years when she allowed unofficial people to access officially protected voter records
- January 6th was done by Antifa, it was not
- They said Ray Epps was guilty while Owen Shroyer was here chanting 1776.
- COVID Lockdowns and BLM riots are not Trump’s fault, but Biden is blamed for inflation and everything for COVID.
- Biden DNC coup but Trump didn’t do a single debate.
- They care about Epstein’s flight logs with Clinton, but not the pictures with Trump.
- They care about Hunter Biden’s Burisma ties, but not Jared Kushner’s Saudi Arabian loan from MBS.
