# Location
- Concerning Mandatory Palestine
# Causes
- This resulted from the Peel Commission recommending partition and the unmanageable violence that followed from both the Arabs and Jews.
# Facts
- A four-part document, the Partition Plan, was attached, that provided for the termination of the Mandate, the withdrawal of British armed forces, and the [delineation of boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UN_Palestine_Partition_Versions_1947.jpg) between the two States and Jerusalem.
# Outcome
- The Arab Higher Committee and the Arab League rejected this proposal due to the fact that 56% of the land would be allocated to the Jewish state, despite the Palestinian Arab population numbering twice that of the Jewish population. The Jewish Agency for Palestine and most Zionist factions accepted.
