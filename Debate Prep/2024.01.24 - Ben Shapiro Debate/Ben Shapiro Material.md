Broad Political Narratives I'd like to Outline
1. Ben Shapiro contributes to one-sided historical analysis.
2. The Trump leadership's downstream effects can be seen across all of the Republican leadership.
	1. The Speaker of the House fiasco is a great example of this.
3. Donald Trump is not healthy for the Republican party or for the conservative movement.
	1. He attacks conservative leadership, "dividing Republican against Republican."
	2. He's inconsistent on his values and beliefs (are they even conservative?).
	3. He chooses poor candidates to back in races.
	4. He doesn't fundraise for candidates. (*Do presidents normally do this?*)
4. Donald Trump's record on any of the large issues he ran on is not good.
	1. Foreign wars, he ended none.
	2. Border security he failed on.
	3. Balanced budget he failed on.
	4. Gun control increased under Donald Trump.

Two large strains of argumentation
1. Donald Trump is a bad candidate to support if you are truly a conservative.
2. Joe Biden is a better candidate for the overall health of America.

Hi Destiny,

Listening to your talk with Pisco about potential Ben Shapiro debate topics. A couple items I think that would be good to brush up on ahead of time, if it ends up being Trump vs Biden's record / foreign policy. 

Trump | Afghanistan
https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/08/donald-trump-joe-biden-afghanistan
My thoughts: Not only did Trump negotiate the withdrawal and pushed it to Biden's administration, but Trump BRAGGED about how Biden couldn't have stopped the process even if he wanted to. Trump clip in June 2021, 2 months prior to withdrawal: https://twitter.com/theNuzzy/status/1427051039404957697

Trump | refusal to pull us out of Yemen, against rare bipartisanship in Congress
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html
My thoughts: I bring this up as an example to MAGA family whenever they say Trump is against foreign wars. 

Trump | Yemen raid
https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/02/02/512490365/yemen-aftermath-trumps-first-military-raid-continues-to-raise-questions
My thoughts: I recalled this while watching your talk with Tim Pool when he was obsessed with Obama's "extrajudicial killings". Immediately upon taking office, Trump called on a military raid in Yemen (one that the Obama administration didn't do because it was considered too risky), resulting in the deaths of women, children, and an American SEAL. 

Trump | Drone Program
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/us/politics/trump-drone-strike-rules.html
My thoughts: Not only did Trump expand America's drone program, but made it harder to account for civilian casualties. 

2018-19 Government Shutdown
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_United_States_federal_government_shutdown
My thoughts: Trump had one of the longest government shutdowns while Republicans controlled BOTH houses. Insane. If I recall, the Democrats were even going to give Trump all the border wall funding he wanted so long as he saved DACA. But Stephen Miller (arguably one of the actual racists in Trump's cabinet) stopped it, receiving criticism from Lindsey Graham. 

Good luck!

Hey Steven,

Thought I share this timestamped video with you from Ben Shapiro's Oxford Union QA this week (5 minutes max) . One of the audience members asks Ben why he would support Trump over Biden. Ben goes into his rational and reasons for disliking Biden more, I think it's an excellent starting place for formulating your arguments and research for the upcoming debate.

That said I think debating the legitimacy of settlements or Zionism seems more interesting since its a more unique view Ben holds.

Thanks, 



REPUBLICANS CAN'T RULE
- FIRST TIME EVER MAJORITY LOSES HOUSE SPEAKER SEAT???
- What legislation have Republicans brought to the House floor?
	- Under Pelosi, it was a record amount of legislation. (fact check)

In April 2009, a Novel H1N1 influenza A (genetically distinct from seasonal flu virus) strain of swine origin was identified. Unlike previous seasonal influenza viruses, this pandemic influenza virus disproportionately infects a wider age-range of people. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) recommendations, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines for employers to assist them in the development of a framework in preparing their workplaces in order to minimize transmission of a pandemic virus.

OSHA does expect facilities providing healthcare services to perform a risk assessment of their workplace and encourages healthcare employers to offer both the seasonal and H1N1 vaccines. It is important to note that employees need to be properly informed of the benefits of the vaccinations. However, although OSHA does not specifically require employees to take the vaccines, an employer may do so. In that case, an employee who refuses vaccination because of a reasonable belief that he or she has a medical condition that creates a real danger of serious illness or death (such as serious reaction to the vaccine) may be protected under Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 pertaining to whistle blower rights.

"As Hitler controlled the masses support for the political right, the conservative elite believed that they could use Hitler and his popular support to ‘democratically’ take power. Once in power, Hitler could destroy the political left.  Destroying the political left would help to remove the majority of political opponents to the ring-wing conservative elite.
Once Hitler had removed the left-wing socialist opposition and destroyed the Weimar Republic, the conservative elite thought they would be able to replace Hitler, and appoint a leader of their choice."

Read this and thought it might be a useful line of attack for the biden/trump debate. Beyond policy, what about character, values, and real leadership?

Some quotes:

"Was it stupid that, in February, Trump was tweeting about how Covid-19 was like the flu and that we didn’t need to worry? Yes, but it takes on a different color when you listen to him tell Bob Woodward that in January he knew how bad it was, how much worse it was than even the worst flu, and that he was deliberately going to downplay the virus for political purposes."

"I guess I just always thought you believed in the lessons you taught me, and the things we used to listen to on talk radio on our drives home from the lake. All those conversations about American dignity, the power of private enterprise, the sacredness of the Oval Office, the primacy of the rule of law."

"If Donald Trump were even half-competent, one elected official told me, he could probably rule this country for 20 years. I have trouble figuring what’s worse—that he wants to, or that he wants to but isn’t competent enough to pull it off. Instead, Washington is so broken and so filled with cowards that Trump just spent the last four years breaking stuff and embarrassing himself."

"Or is it worse, that my own father cares more about his retirement accounts—and I’ll grant, the runup of the market has been nice for me, too—than the future he is leaving for his children? Are you so afraid of change, of that liberal boogeyman Limbaugh and Hannity and these other folks have concocted, that you’d rather entrust the country to a degenerate carnival barker than anyone else? I see all this anger, what is it that you’re so angry about? You’ve won. Society has worked for you. My own success is proof."

"So what is it? Because it can’t possibly be that you think this guy is trustworthy, decent, or kind. It’s definitely not about his policies… because almost every single one is anathema to what Republicans—and you—have talked about my entire life."
