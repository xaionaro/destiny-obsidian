Should Biden be the Democratic Nominee?

Frame
1. We should be choosing the person who's the strongest mobilizer of votes for the Democratic Party who also roughly represents the aggregate views of the Democratic Party.
2. When we criticize ourselves or our party, it's important that we listen to people who have the best interest of the party in mind. Outsiders who hate the party will always have a reason to criticize the party, and listening to their criticisms does nothing to strengthen your own position.

Function
1. Right now, there are no other candidates that have been as field-tested as Biden has been. Barring a massive swing in aggregate polling, it's likely too late to swap out Biden with another candidate. No one else has been as field-tested as Biden currently is, Biden still defeated Trump once before, and Biden's record for the last four years clearly bests Trump's four years in office.
2. Cenk and his partner wouldn't support swapping out Biden for another moderate Democratic candidate. Before the debate performance, neither of them were willing to support Biden, so why are they even fixating on this performance?

Further
1. Supporting Biden is our best shot at beating Trump, and that should be the thing we are focused on when it comes to 
2. We shouldn't listen to criticism from people who don't have our best interests at heart and instead should focus on furthering our own political goals with feedback from people who have those political goals in common.
