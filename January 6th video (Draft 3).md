# Video Outline
## Thesis
Donald Trump and his associates knowingly made false claims of voter fraud in an attempt to pressure state legislatures to decertify their vote, or, failing that, to get Congress or Mike Pence to refuse to certify Biden as the election winner on January 6th. This was planned before the election even took place, and Trump and his associates knowingly incited a riot on January 6th in the furtherance of their schemes. Link videos here of Stone and Bannon talking about how they want to “stop the count” (along with Trump saying this and tweeting this) on election night.
## Setting the Stage
From the very beginning, there is a full plan on how to disrupt every major date associated with the election. Trump tries to stop the count on November 3rd, interfere with states certifying their votes, create confusion around the electors voting on December 14th, and rejecting the process outlined by the ECA on January 6th.

At no point is there a genuine interest in discovering voter fraud or pursuing actual evidence of fraud trusting the official tools available to Trump. Rather, he will instead reach out to find only the most loyal sycophants who are willing to stress the Republic to its extremes while fabricating claims of voter fraud.
### Pence’s Story (November 3rd)
#### Characters
- Bad Guys
	- Donald Trump
- Good Guys
	- Mike Pence
#### Presentation
- Fox News calls it for Arizona, leaving the Trump camp in shambles. Trump attempts to call the election immediately, but Pence comes up and reminds everyone that every vote will be counted.
### Voter Fraud Claims (>November 3rd - December 3rd)
This section will open up with character introductions, then introducing the voter fraud claims. Voter fraud claims started before the election even took place, and then continued well after it took place, with almost all of them being shot down, many times instantly. Here we’ll focus on three, obvious lies, implicating all of the major Trump players, with two resolving in lawsuits in which the accusers admit to essentially fabricating the claims.

	- Kenneth Chesebro
	- John Eastman
	- Mark Meadows
	- Jason Miller
#### Presentation
- Present the concept. Let’s say we win a court case or two, so what? Does that guarantee Trump wins the election? No, we have to fight on the certification, so let’s create fake electors. Chesebro hatches a scheme to have Pence reject the ECA and choose an alternate slate of electors.
- There’s a full explanation of what exactly the elector scheme is and what it entails.
	- What is the ECA?
		- What does it mean to violate the ECA?
	- What is the 12th amendment?
		- How does it apply here?
	- What is the independent state legislature theory?
		- How does it apply here?
Present Meadows and Miller beginning to gather the 79 needed Republican electors. End with Joshua Findlay saying how Trump wanted to pursue this by December 7th/8th.
## Minor Confrontation
The goal of the DoJ Fraud and the 64 Court Cases was to try and pressure state legislatures to retract their electoral college votes, based on unsupported ideas relating to the independent state legislature theory, which cites to two lines in the Constitution. The implication, according to the lunatics who pushed this conspiracy, was that state legislatures had the power to choose a different outcome for their elections, circumventing their ordinary procedures, state governors, state courts, state constitutions and the will of their population of voters.

The false electoral slates were the ace in the hole for the Trump admin. If the state legislatures didn’t go along with what they wanted, they could still choose from the false set of electors on January 6th.
### DoJ Fraud (November 23rd - December 14th)
#### Characters
- Bad Guys
	- Donald Trump
- Good Guys
	- Bill Barr
#### Presentation
- Bill Barr has given up on trying to verify any of the alleged voter fraud from earlier. Trump continually throws the DoJ under the bus, resulting in Barr giving an interview to the Associated Press to dispel myths that the DoJ wasn’t doing anything to investigate. Bill Barr would eventually resign, after a big shouting match over dinner, on the 14th.
## More Building
### Pence’s Story (November 15th - December 27th)
#### Characters
- Bad Guys
	- Donald Trump
	- Mike Eastman
	- Gohmert
	- Jenna Ellis
- Good Guys
	- Mike Pence
	- Gregory Jacob
#### Presentation
- Since November 15th, Pence had only tweeted or retweeted things about voting irregularities. Pence had no signed on to any of Trump’s conspiracies yet, saying he would “keep fighting until every legal vote is counted” and “every illegal vote is thrown out.”
- On December 8th, Jacobs begins to advise the VP on the illegality of Eastman’s theory.
- Memos reveal that Eastman didn’t believe the claims would ever even go to court. They just wanted Trump to remain president for as long as possible from December 14th and December 22nd.
- On December 27th, Gomert filed a court case to pressure Pence against certifying the election.
### Voter Fraud Claims (November 28th - January 3rd)
- Showing all of the repetition throughout Trump’s camp and others on social media amplifying the voter fraud claims.
#### Characters
- Bad Guys
	- Main Characters
		- Donald Trump
		- Rudy Giuliani
		- Sydney Powell
		- Alternative Media
			- OAN, Steve Bannon, The Gateway Pundit
		- Mainstream Media
			- Fox News, Sean Hannity, others
	- Side Characters
		- Senator Doug Mastriano
#### Presentation
- Spam videos of press conferences, tweets, media appearances, over and over and over again, rotating between all three of the lies. Notice that there is not a single shred of hard evidence for a single one of the claims, despite the unprecendently historic conspiracy that is being alleged. Nothing of this magnitude has occurred in all of US history. On November 27th(?), Powell spoke about releasing “The Kraken”. Stories from the media, articles debunking these can be added here.

### DoJ Fraud (December 14th - January 2nd)
#### Characters
- Bad Guys
	- Donald Trump
	- Jeff Clark
- Good Guys
	- Bill Barr
	- Richard Donoghue
	- Jeffery Rosen
#### Presentation
- Trump knows that his cases are failing. He won’t be able to rely on the outcome of any of those cases, nor any legitimate investigation from the DoJ to overturn any of the swing states he lost on. Now he turns his attention to his new DoJ and attempts to weaponize them against the states. If Trump can get his new DoJ on his side, perhaps they don’t need to win any of their court cases nor find any actual evidence of voter fraud.
- After Barr’s resignation, Trump has a big meeting on the 15th to go over more voter fraud evidence. He floats the idea of making Sydney Powell a special counsel, and Trump starts publicly calling for the DoJ to do more. Scott Perry would introduce Jeffery Clark to Trump on the 22nd, with Trump mentioning his name to Rosen on the 24th.
- Trump tries to just bully Donoghue and Rosen into “calling the election corrupt and leaving the rest to him.” On December 27th.
- After realizing they won’t accept any of his fraudulent evidence, Trump attempts to insert Clark into the DoJ. Maybe pressure from within the DoJ will convince them to act in Trump’s favor? On the 28th, Clark shoots an email to Rosen and Donoghue, asking them to sign along with a false DoJ statement alleging they found voter fraud for states to overturn their votes. He specifically references the independent state legislature theory in the email.
- Trump asks for a lawsuit from the DoJ to be filed for states to toss their election.
- Clark gets progressively more involved, with Meadows requesting him to go to Fulton county to find voter fraud.
- Donoghue and Rosen prepare for the worst after Clark mentions, on January 2nd, that he’d be replacing Rosen.
