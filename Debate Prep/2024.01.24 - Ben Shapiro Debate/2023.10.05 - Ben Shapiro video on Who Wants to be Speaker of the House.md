		- She [supported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhe9Fd6YRyA) 9/11 conspiracy theories.
		- She [harassed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM05FwyhHPA) a school shooting victim, David Hogg, about using children as shields for red flag laws. She also claims that he's a paid actor in the same video.

		- She [supported](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html) executing Democratic leaders like Pelosi and members of the FBI before running for Congress.
		- She [mentioned](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html) Jewish space lasers causing fires in California.

	- Biden's answer here was incredibly diplomatic and exactly what we need right now.
- 41:10 - The reason these Kaiser strikes are happening is because Joe Biden is president of the United States.
	- Really? Did any strikes at all happen under Trump?
- 41:27 - Economic stagnation is the real threat of the Biden administration.
	- Isn't the US outcompeting the G7?
- 42:00 - Where's AOC crying about the border wall?
