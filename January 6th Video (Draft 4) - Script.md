## Opening Statement
### Narration
*On January 6th, 2021, tens of thousands of citizens marched down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the US Capitol Building to protest the reported outcome of the 2020 US Presidential Election. Reports of voter fraud of all kind, including ballot harvesting, fraudulent signatures, sabotaged voting machines, illegal procedures and all other manner of malfeasance had ignited concerns among the Republican party, pushing them to follow Trump in asking the Congress for more time to present their case to the courts and legislatures of 7 different swing states. The events on January 6th escalated past the point most people had foreseen, leading to millions of dollars in damage, hundreds of injuries and a protestor, Ashli Babbitt, shot dead inside the Capitol Building.*

*Much is said about the events of January 6th, both as they unfolded and in how they are recounted as the event has passed. There is no shortage of blame laid upon the different parties involved leading up to the event. On the Republican said, many blame the media for their lax coverage of legitimate concerns about the integrity of the vote, especially as it related to the unprecedented utilization of mail-in ballots and electronic voting machines. On the Democratic side, others say irresponsible rhetoric undermining the voting process and Donald Trump's invitation and incitement of his audience lead to a predictable outcome that could have been entirely avoided.*

*For much of history, there is a paucity of detailed material to go over to satisfy ones curiosity about how events have unfolded during chaotic times. Thankfully, for this case, there is a striking abundancy of publicly available testimony, reliable and corroborated reports from across the media, treasure troves of electronic communications and direct video evidence of much of what occurred. Let's take a look at some of this material, and see if we can figure out if the events of January 6th were truly brought upon us by the inevitable march of time, or if wiser minds and more responsible leaders could have avoided the events that unfolded on that day.*
## Setting the Stage
### Election Night
- November 3rd, 2020 | 18:00 ET - [MSNBC Election Coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9vchVOLkzg) 0:00-0:15
*The entire country awaited the election results on pins and needles as the first statewide polls came to a close at 7 PM ET on November 3rd. Despite Trump's [predicted](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/) chances at winning the election being a mere 10% by election forecaster's such as 538, Republicans were convinced that they would be vindicated once more of the bias of the mainstream media and the unreliability of their polling once Trump came roaring back to his second election victory. Democrats. meanwhile, exuded anxiety that those very same errors that haunted pollsters in 2016 would come creeping back in as the votes were tallied, leading to another crushing Democratic defeat.*

*At 7 o'clock, ET, 6 states, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia began to report the [first official](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-time-do-polls-close-each-state-2020-election-day/) results of the night. Though the early results looked promising for Trump, as the night inched by second by second into the early hours of the next morning, things began to change... We were starting to see the results of the mail-in ballots.*

*It had been known for quite some time that mail-in ballots and the delays caused by their reporting could not only draw out the election results themselves, but cause a shift back towards Biden as the counting progressed.*

*Bernie's prediction, made almost two weeks before in-person voting even began, was more accurate than he could have ever known.*

*Before the election even began, the psychological groundwork had already been set for Trump to declare victory on the night of the 3rd, even if the results were still pending. He was even discouraging his voters from utilizing mail-in ballots at all, instead heavily driving them towards voting in person on November 3rd.*

*Trump spent months asserting that mail-in ballots would be used to rig the election while discouraging their use by Republicans. If enough Republicans voted on election night, giving Trump a massive edge after the polling stations closed, it may be enough for Trump to call himself the winner and force an end to the counting. The situation was dire enough that [Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/09/can-trump-supreme-court-decide-election.html) went as far as to say the "Fox News Decision Desk \[controlled] the fate of American democracy," with the New York Times [exalting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/business/media/trump-election-fox-news.html) Arnon Mishkin as one who "may be the last bulwark against the most frightening prophecies of electoral insanity."

*Political allies close to Trump claimed he would call the election even if he was losing, surmising that this might become necessary to stall the Democrats from having a legitimate claim to winning the election.*
**Character Introduction**
- **Steve Bannon**
	- On-Screen Text
		- Co-founder of far-right media outlet Breitbart News and served on the board of Cambridge Analytica
		- Senior Counselor to the the President and White House Chief Strategist (Jan 20th, 2017 - August 18th, 2017))
	- *Steve Bannon was appointed chief of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign with only 88 days until the election. He was known primarily for his role in founding Breitbart News, "[the platform for the alt-right,](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-alt-right-breitbart-news/)" as Bannon bragged in an interview to Mother Jones. After winning the election, Donald Trump appointed him as Senior Counsel in the White House where he remained for several months. He's believed to have served as a close advisor to Trump up through at least his 2020 election run. He also hosts his own podcast, War Room: Pandemic, where he broadcasted multiple times a day leading up to and through January 6th.
- **Roger Stone**
	- On-Screen Text
		- Political consultant for a wide variety of Republican politicians, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Donald Trump
		- No official positions with the Trump White House, but served closely as an advisor during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
	- *Roger Stone is a legendary political consultant with a history of assisting Republican candidates run aggressive campaigns. He was the go-between for Trump's campaign and Guccifer 2.0, the persona, alleged to be a Russian military agent, claiming to be the hacker who released hacked material from the DNC to the media and Wikileaks. Roger Stone has a history of flying off the handle, whether in depositions or to the media, and can be as entertaining as he is clever and dangerous.*

*Results continued to pour in through the night and, as expected, making predictions about battleground states where the race was tightest was exceedingly difficult. Voters and interested viewers from around the world waited on the edge of their seats as every media network attempted to project and guess which states would go for Biden and which states would go for Trump.*

*Then, at around 11:20 PM, disaster struck for the Trump campaign. As predicted by the New York Times, it was indeed Arnon Mishkin of the Fox News Decision Desk who came bulldozing through the Trump campaign, shattering their plans for the night.*

*Before any other main stream media network, and to the chagrin of Trump and his campaign, Fox News called Arizona for Joe Biden, making the path towards victory far the Trump campaign incredibly arduous and threatening their ability to claim victory on the night of the 3rd.*

*At around 12:50 AM, with results still being tallied across the US and the results starting to lean heavily in favor of the former Vice President, the Biden camp decides to call it a night, ending with some words in Delaware to his supporters while stressing the importance of counting every vote.*

*Trump fired off multiple claims of voter fraud just two days after the election. Votes were still being counted, and no official investigation nor evidence of voter fraud had even materialized.

## Preparing the Battlefield
### Narration
*The battle on November 3rd may have ended in defeat, but the war was far from over. At this point, Trump and his associates engaged in a complicated, multi-layered scheme to either prevent the states' electors from voting on December 14th, or prevent the actual certification of their vote in Congress on January 6th.

*The strategies employed were numerous, and of those strategies, there are a huge number of variables to consider, from parties involved, cases filed, and people contacted to reverse the November 3rd defeat. I want to show you a few examples that I think accurately characterize what was attempted by the Trump campaign during what should have been a transition from one administration to the next.*

*As we step from strategy to strategy, I'll take a moment to explain some fundamental aspects of how our government works, as well as some legal concepts that aren't always well understood. People make these out to be more complicated than they seem, sometimes to obscure bad behavior, and sometimes because they lack the understanding themselves.*
### Concepts and Characters
*A litany of claims were made about voter fraud, all involving a combination of affidavits, esoteric legal theories and counsel that came from outside the White House. All of them involve some version of either too many ballots being cast, some type of miscounting or hidden ballot box, or a machine either malfunctioning or being sabotaged. We'll focus on three of those claims that exemplifies each type of accusation made, but first, we need to introduce some concepts and characters.*
**Concept Introduction**
- **Legal Counsel**
	- On-Screen Text
		- The Department of Justice [map](https://www.justice.gov/agencies/chart/map) highlighting the Office of Legal Counsel
		- The White House Office staff [map](https://www.whitehousetransitionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WHTP2021-100-White-House-Overall-2021.pdf) showing where the White House Counsel sits
	- *The President is armed with some of the fiercest legal representation in the world. The Department of Justice, authorized and created by Congress over 150 years ago, was created to assist the President of the United States in carrying out his duties as the chief law enforcement officer. The President, when acting in his official capacity, is assisted by The Office of Legal Counsel, which exists within the DoJ. In 2010, when Barack Obama was unsure on whether or not he could order the killing of an American citizen believed to be an al-Qaeda regional commander, he went to his Department of Justice seeking clarity. The [memo](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/pages/attachments/2015/04/02/2010-07-16_-_olc_aaga_barron_-_al-aulaqi.pdf) justifying the President's actions was produced by David Barron, the Assistant Attorney General, or head, of the Office of Legal Counsel. There's also the White House counsel senior staff position, which exists within the Office of the White House, which is tasked with assisting the president in many of the day-to-day tasks of running the Executive branch.
	- *It's important to keep note of this because it's considered highly unusual for the president to hire personal counsel to work on matters of official government business. While it might seem that a lawyer is just a lawyer, there is a significant difference between a government lawyer, who's job is to represent the best interests of the United States Federal Government, as opposed to a personal lawyer who's job is simply to represent the best interests of whoever employs them.*
- **Presidential Elections**
	- On-Screen Text
		- [Article II, Section 1, Clause 2](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) of the US Constitution
	- *A common misconception in our country is that citizens have a right to vote for the President. In reality, the writers of the Constitution were more concerned with protecting the rights of the States, leaving anything [not explicitly delegated](https://i.etsystatic.com/6943688/r/il/998949/2765236057/il_fullxfull.2765236057_351c.jpg) to the Federal Congress up to the States. The Constitution explicitly spells out that States shall appoint, in whatever way their Legislatures direct, a number of electors, equaling the number of senators and representatives they have, to cast ballots for the President. As of 2024, every state has decided to hold their own elections within their states that allow them to assign their electors to vote for the majority winner in their state, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska whom allocate their electors proportionally between the two candidates based on the percentages each receives.
	- *This will become important to keep in mind for three, key reasons. First, it is the State's that choose the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections." This means that any problems or challenges with the voting process need to be resolved at the State level, as the Federal government simply does not have a right to intervene and dictate to a State how they are to hold their elections, thus they would lack standing to bring the case. Second, the State legislatures are called out explicitly in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean the State legislatures have  magical authority granted to them that allows them to operate independently of their State Courts or Constitutions, as plainly decided in [Moore v. Harper](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf). Third and lastly, the important and somewhat scary implication is that, to truly rig any federal election, one not need rig the vote in the state, one only need to control the actual electors or electoral votes of said states. More on this to come...*
**Character Introduction**
- **Rudy Giuliani**
	- On-Screen Text
		- The 107th Mayor of New York City (Jan 1st, 1994 - Dec 31st, 2001)
		- United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (June 3rd, 1983 - Jan 1st, 1989)
		- United States Associate Attorney General (Feb 20, 1981 - June 3, 1983)
		- Personal advisor to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign
	- *Rudy Giuliani, known originally for his historic federal prosecution of the Mafia in 1985 using the newly minted RICO statute, and then endearingly as "America's Mayor" as he presided over New York City during and immediately after 9/11, came into Trump's fold as his personal advisor to his 2016 presidential campaign. He was hired by Trump for personal representation in April of 2018, and remained on his legal team through Trump's 2020 election challenges.*
- **Sidney Powell**
	- On-Screen Text
		- Graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 1987
		- One of the youngest federal prosecutors in the United States
	- *At only 23 years of age, Sydney Powell began her career as a federal prosecutor for the Western and Northern Districts of Texas. She was highly critical of the Mueller investigation into the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and began making appearances on Fox News to discuss the case against Michael Flynn. Trump took notice of her ardent defense of those around him and, on November 14th, 2020, established a legal team that also included Giuliani for the purpose of challenging the legitimacy of the November 3rd results. It's important to note that neither Rudy Giuliani nor Sydney Powell held official positions in the White House or Government and only served as Trump's personal lawyers.*
### Searching for Voter Fraud
*There were many different voter fraud claims floated by Trump's campaign, Republican lawmakers and conservative media sources. While it's impossible to go into detail of all of them, we can follow three different clear voter fraud accusations made by the Trump campaign.*

*On November 27th, Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano tweeted out what he saw as a discrepancy between the total mail-in votes received and the total number of votes mailed out by the State. This seemed to reinforce earlier statements from Trump that more ballots were being sent out and returned than were actual valid voters in the states.

*These allegations, and others like it, set the stage for the Trump campaign to accomplish a few different things. It sets up a good avenue to pressure the Department of Justice to launch investigations into the states. It allows the Trump campaign to launch dozens of lawsuits across multiple state and federal courts. It inflames the public, helping them in turn put pressure on the vote certification, and it serves as a foundation on which Trump's campaign can hand-craft their own elector slates in 7 different states.*
### Weaponizing the DoJ

- **William Barr**
	- On-Screen Text
		- 77th and 85th United States Attorney General (Nov 26th, 1991 - Jan 20th, 1993 & Feb 14th, 2019 - Dec 23, 2020)
	- *William Barr, regarded as "[Trump's sword and shield](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield)" in a profile piece by the New Yorker, served as the head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, during Trump's last year and a half in office. Barr was generally willing to do Trump's bidding as he saw the need for more expansion of Presidential control over the Executive Branch of government, among other things.
Barr was asked by Almost immediately after the election, Donald Trump demanded he begin opening federal investigations of voter fraud across the states he lost. When asked why he even opened the investigations proactively, rather than waiting for credible evidence to emerge, Barr said...

### Electoral Slate Fraud
*As mentioned earlier, there is nothing inherently wrong with challenging a process or procedure if you felt as though a law was broken or a right was violated. Donald Trump and his associates had every right to pursue whatever instances of voter fraud they saw fit, assuming the lawsuits were being filed in good faith and all of the underlying material was true, to the best of their knowledge. The Trump campaign was facing a few major obstacles, however. The affidavits supporting their lawsuits weren't alleging a level of fraudulent behavior that was likely to significantly impact the outcome of any of the State elections, let alone the entire election itself. And time was not working in their favor. Barely a month away, on December 14th, the State electors would be voting and transmitting their votes to Congress to be counted on the 6th. What if Trump's team was able to find some kind of fraud, but the Electors had already placed their votes? What if they weren't able to find enough fraud to significantly challenge the election at all?*

*There was a darker option that pursued, in the event that all litigation failed and state legislatures weren't persuaded to change their votes at all. But first, we need to discuss a few more concepts and introduce a few more characters.*
**Concept Introduction**
- **The Electoral Count Act**
	- On-Screen Text
		- The [Electoral Count Act of 1887](https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/24/STATUTE-24-Pg373.pdf)
	- *Ten years after the extremely contentious presidential election of 1876, Congress passed the Electoral Count Act. This statute set forth an actual framework and procedure by which the States are to certify their Electoral votes and how to transmit them to Congress. Once transmitted to Congress, the act dictates how Congress is to go about counting each Electoral votes, with an opportunity for Congress to dispute any of the Electoral votes if they had been handled improperly by the States.*
	- *To be clear, the challenging of the Electoral votes on January 6th was never in any way meant to be a way to challenge voter fraud. As per the ECA, it was only ever meant as a means to clear up any confusion about submitted votes, and "no electoral vote or votes from any State which shall have been regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully certified to according to section three of -this act from which but one return has been received shall be rejected."*
**Character Introduction**
- **John Eastman**
	- On-Screen Text
		- Founding director of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence
		- Former professor and former dean of Chapman University School of Law
	- *John Eastman became associated with Trump's campaign on December 9th, when he filed a motion to intervene in the Texas v. Pennsylvania case before the Supreme Court. In the aforementioned case, Texas sought to challenge the electoral college results of several other states. On December 12th, the Supreme Court rejected the case, finding that Texas had no right to challenge the electoral processes of other States. Regardless of the outcome, Eastman was on the Trump's radar, and would later join Trump as a personal attorney on January 2nd to assist him and others in filing suits alleging voter fraud.
Kenneth Chesebro was an attorney from Wisconsin who began working with the Trump campaign at the request of Jim Troupis, another lawyer for Trump's campaign, around November 9th, a day after requested to work with the campaign.*

*On the 18th, Chesebro finalized the memo and sent it to Troupis. In the email, he laid the groundwork for what Trump's team would eventually pursue, which was the creation of seven fraudulent slates of electors.*

*In Chesebro's memo, he argued that the important date for the certification of the State elections wasn't actually the 14th of December, the deadline set by the ECA for the States to transmit their votes, but rather January 6th, when the votes were to be counted by Congress. His argument was, if the state legislatures agreed to send two sets of elector slates, as Hawaii had in 1960 when a recount was required to determine the actual winner, perhaps the Trump campaign could extend the amount of time available to them to discover enough fraud to overturn the election results in some key states.*

## Recap
*Even though the results on November 3rd weren't quite what Trump was hoping for, there were still many paths, some legitimate and some not as much, for Trump to remain in the White House. Powell and the rest of Trump's legal team had filed dozens of lawsuits across several states, the public was becoming inflamed with the idea of rampant voter fraud and election corruption, and the Department of Justice had been set to work to uncover any and all evidence that the results of the election were illegitimate. Ideally, State legislatures would begin to see the arguments the Trump camp was putting forth, forcing them to And, if all else failed, Trump and his team might have a crazy shot at simply dismissing the valid electoral votes in Congress, substituting them with their own fraudulently prepared batch of electors.*

*Not everything had been going perfectly, however...*

		- 48th Vice President of the United States (Jan 20th, 2017 - Jan 20th, 2021)
	- *Mike Pence, likely chosen by Trump's campaign to shore up evangelical votes and other traditional parts of the Republican electorate. At the time, Trump was not a very popular guy with the Republican electorate, and Pence was the [most conservative](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mike-pence-would-be-a-really-conservative-and-mostly-unknown-vp-pick/) vice-presidential candidate in the last 40 years, according to FiveThirtyEight.*
*In 2020, Pence still wasn't supportive the statements alleging fraud and rigged elections that his running mate was comfortable airing out to any media that would listen. He hung back, quietly in the background as part of the ticket, but always attempted to redirect the conversation to conservative talking points that he felt were more important, rather than get bogged down unsupported claims of fraud.

*After his statement in the twilight hours of November 4th, saying that they'd wait until all of the votes were counted before declaring themselves the winners, Pence largely disappeared from the media for the rest of the year.
