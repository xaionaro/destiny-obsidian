# Response
## Opening
- The audience I'm addressing here is mainly my own, plus the crossover I have with the h3h3 audience. A ton of h3 fans have reached out privately to me and apologized for Ethan's behavior, which I genuinely love and appreciate. I don't really expect to change Ethan's mind, and at this point I'm pretty sure his fanbase is beyond me as well.
- There are a million important things happening in the world right now, and I'd rather be commenting on anything besides this. The only reason we are going back and forth right now on this is because Hasan and other communities are invested in personal shit-slinging to detract from other issues they don't want to confront. I'm not saying that people can't be held accountable or that you can't address issues you have with people, but to jump on this topic right now to just dig up KF threads and old hitpiece videos to shit-sling back and forth is wildly stupid.
- The only reason all of this is all so public is because a malicious actor decided to target me with a revenge porn leak at the end of 2024, dumping over 20 explicit videos of me online, most of them videos of just myself.-
- I don't want to have to relitigate every aspect of my personal life every single time someone has a problem with me. I'll do it here since Ethan has a large audience and it's obviously in my interest to respond, but it's crazy to me that someone targeted so relentlessly for years by snarkers is now making the very same demand of me that he said was unfair when talking about [Keemstar in the past.](https://youtu.be/w3gXcIifc3o?t=2383)
- As a quick aside, when people talk about "predatory" behavior, especially with fans there's a pattern of "stuff" to look out for, namely, aggressively pursuing people you have a significant power dynamic over, flaunting or flexing some kind of power you have over the person to influence them to do things they wouldn't do otherwise, and abusing someone's trust or the influence you have over them as a "creator" to leverage that into some sort of sexual relationship that they never intended or wanted. Almost every single person I've sexually interacted with over the past 15 years has pursued **me**, I am never simply scrolling through Twitter or Instagram or my Discord looking for fans to prey on.
	- I see some people like Ethan saying it's unethical to engage with fans sexually, but where do you even draw the line on that? The power dynamic for creator-creator relationships is much more severe, in my opinion; if a relationship with a fan goes "sideways", then it's awkward for both parties and then you simply move on. Creator-creator relationships going sideways can have severe and dramatic impacts on either creators and can lend themselves to extremely abusive dynamics.
	- I'm not saying creator-fan pairings are magically exempt from abuse, I'm just saying that a yellow flag is not necessarily an "abusive relationship," and you need more evidence to point to some kind of abuse rather than simply writing all of it off as abusive, otherwise you're essentially telling creators that they can't ethically communicate with pretty much anyone.
## Poisoning the Well
Follow along with the video, move through chunks summarizing.
1. 0:00 - 1:58
	1. This incident occurred in 2011, 14 years ago, when I was 22 years old.
	2. How am I "downplaying my actions" here if I'm literally stating that it was sexual assault, stating that my feelings on the topic have changed since then, and have reached out to Mia Rose to apologize?
		1. Even Mia [tweeted](https://x.com/miarosexxx/status/1279476592348028928?lang=en) in 2020 about the excessive drinking and our age.
			1. The subreddit [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/nzhl7/comment/c3d6c6u/) on the excessive drinking.
		2. In 2023 she [tweeted](https://x.com/miarosexxx/status/1635765941106769922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1635765941106769922%7Ctwgr%5E087477f406066e3c3604930f708491fa2c0ed9aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F11rv47q%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue) that I hadn't personally apologized to her. I wasn't sure if that was appropriate to do, as I'd already publicly apologized for the behavior. I messaged her shortly after to apologize, and she [acknowledged](https://x.com/miarosexxx/status/1919584798000943531) as much.
	2. I know I said "for 5 minutes" in the clip, but on stream it was more like 5-10 seconds.
2. 1:58 - 4:01
	1. This incident occurred in 2012, 13 years ago, when I was 23 years old.
	2. Back in the MLG days, pro gaming events were teaming with horny teenagers, pro gamers, people staying at conventions away from home, sometimes for the first time ever, it was fertile ground for bad stuff to happen.
	3. Sometimes young people would message you and shoot you pics, but it's hard to tell sometimes if a girl is 15-16 or 19-20, especially with Asian girls that would show up at events.
	4. When I found out this girl was 15, I cut off contact. I was then talking shit in my team chat about how some of these girls looked of age when they were still minors and not to fuck around at events. These images weren't necessarily "lewd" and definitely not pornographic, I mention her friend in the picture because it's literally a picture of them at the beach with each other.
	5. If I was an actual pedophile, or if I actually enjoyed banging underage girls, wouldn't I be celebrating hooking up with this girl? Why would I be turning her down?
3. 4:01 - 4:39
	1. This incident occurred in 2015, 10 years ago, when I was 26 years old.
	2. [Original video](https://i.arhivach.vc/storage3/6/74/6746834e0e19c88aef958c75c07c0f54.webm)
	3. This is clearly an edgy joke, is this really being interpreted as genuine pedophilic desires?
4. 4:39 - 4:55
	1. I'm unsure of my age in this video, but again, the comment is the exact opposite of "attracted to young people," it's "sometimes 15-16 year old's look older."
5. 4:55 - 6:56
	1. This is an admittedly cringe [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11iiry/comment/c6mrxfm/) from 2012, but all I'm doing is arguing about the usage of the term "pedophilia." For context, this [story](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-ii-pro-gamer-stephano-suspended-and-fined-for-sexual-comments/1100-6398219/) was about an 19 year old pro gamer, Stephano, having texted another player while they were streaming that he'd hooked up with a 14 year old.
	2. The [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11iiry/comment/c6mrxfm/) just described the differences between doing carefully prepared content and live-streaming everything, and I'd explicitly stated in the OP that "I'm not taking a side on any issue or commenting on anything that's happened, just giving you some food for thought."
	3. Also, you give the exact same defense.
		1. [52:29 - 53:32](https://youtu.be/wTZVPoHp_Jk?t=3149)
6. 6:56 - 7:24
	1. I mean...
		1. [10:34 - 10:53](https://youtu.be/uKt7BMUy-40?t=634) Are you on the FBI Watchlist, Ethan?
7. 7:24 - 9:00
	1. This incident occurred in 2010, 15 years ago, when I was 21 years old.
	2. In the early days of streaming, it was literally the wild west. You would see all sorts of insane/crazy things between ustream.com, livestream.com, and justin.tv.
	3. I have no idea why Ethan engages in baseless conjecture about us "spending a lot of time there," the whole point was just to hop from stream to stream trolling users on the site.
8. 9:00 - 9:57
	1. A lot of people like to throw this clip at me, but the reality is that the entire conversation was about the life experience and maturity of the average 19 year old, **especially** in this context because the 19 year old in question was literally being preyed upon by the person I was speaking to.
		1. [0:23 - 0:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQPgjKgDEGU&t=23s)
		2. [2:27 - 3:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQPgjKgDEGU&t=147s)

		5. [8:19 - 9:36](https://youtu.be/MQPgjKgDEGU?t=499)
9. 9:57 - 10:24
	1. Yes, congratulations, you're basically restating what I've stated in this clip that you cut the context out of.
		1. [45:37 - 48:05](https://youtu.be/7IFqGCKQous?t=2737)
10. 10:24 - 12:18
	1. Ethan, you obsessively have made jokes about pedophiles and pedophilia, there are entire compilations of you guys doing it.
	2. What pattern of "normalization" have you even established? Mia wasn't a minor, I've made some edgy jokes, and I had logs telling fellow pro gamers NOT to fuck minors. This is the pattern of a pedophile??
11. 12:18 - 12:57
	1. Technically Mr. Meseeks are only seconds old, but does this not count as lolicon? Or is it different because it's just another one of Ethan Klein's hilarious pedo jokes?
		1. [49:17 - 49:55](https://youtu.be/h-sbveUVSUc?t=2957)
		2. [Confirmed](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Summer_Smith) 17 year old.
12. 12:57 - 13:17
	1. Sorry, I guess 8 years is old is where we draw the pedophile line?
		1. [55:31 - 55:49](https://youtu.be/wTZVPoHp_Jk?t=3331)
13. 13:17 - 13:27
	1. These aren't "just a few clips," these are the same smears that get passed around about me every single few months whenever someone needs to make a new hit-piece on me. It's especially ironic that you would engage in this conduct, given how many insanely crazy/pedophiliac jokes you yourself have made.

14. 13:27 - 14:34
	1. This is literally just leaked revenge porn/explicit sexual messages of mine that you are reading on your show and getting some sick satisfaction out of. How can you possibly claim to have the moral high ground on literally anything when you are engaging in some of the most disgusting possible behavior someone could engage in on the internet? And if you originally thought they were a minor, why would you read them, then? Aren't you literally just reading sexual material that you claim is exploiting a minor for your audience?
## Rose
1. 14:34 - 25:59 **Cannot Watch**
	1. At no point have I ever told anyone that I have any CSAM on my computer. I do not have any CSAM on my computer. I did not send any CSAM to WillyMac. I did not have CSAM open while communicating with Willy. If you want to interpret things from messages that were leaked for a YouTube video in the most egregious way possible, by all means, be my guest. I suppose we'll see when the FBI shows up. There is no honest way to go through these leaked messages when people are literally spam calling the FBI to swat me again, though. Since the authorities have been notified, hopefully you're okay with how they choose to resolve things. I've already been SWATTed once and you're encouraging me to just freely talk about and address a sensitive issue that's already before a court,
	2. If you want to assume I'm not utilizing my $100k/month legal counsel, you're free to make that assumption, but almost all of the legal advice given by Ethan in this video is complete and utter dogshit. Perhaps you could get the clown writer for your three lawsuits with Denims/Frogan/Kaceytron to give you more advice or information about this.
	3. It's ridiculous that Willy would publish this video, for a number of reasons, and then somehow I am put in a situation where I'm supposed to dump a whole bunch of information onto the internet concerning this when I already have an important ongoing civil case, especially when none of it would convince anyone on the opposing side and when my extremely litigious opposition is dumping every single statement I make into this in yet another stupid court motion to drag out my case with her. If Willy wants to report me to the FBI, that's fine, **I have absolutely zero problem with that**, but putting a video out there publicly literally undermines whatever it is he was hoping to accomplish, and helped to spread a [ton of lies](https://x.com/zei_squirrel/status/1959153851010830838) about what it is I even communicated to him. I was not the one to originally reach out to this person, and I have never purchased anything from them as well, both lies I see repeated across multiple communities now, including by Ethan himself.
	4. The idea that selling material on Twitter makes you "more likely" to be underage or not is stupid, plenty of people sell material on Twitter because it is the only large social media platform that still allows you to post NSFW material and because you can market you stuff on there to some extent, which is impossible if you have an OnlyFans with no outside fan base. You get a higher cut from selling direct to people, you have instant access to all of your money where there's no minimum payout required, etc...etc...
	5. It's very easy to cherry pick a few DMs to make it seem as though this person was a minor, but the things that people are pointing to now are beyond retarded, saying that only children wear braces or only children live with or visit family.
2. 25:59 - 26:11
	1. Every time Ethan mentions her boyfriend, he mentions her very passively as "reaching out to me," ignoring the fact that the only reason he was reaching out to me was to blackmail me while leaking all of my explicit material. Ethan also stated that I reached out to Rose, but that is absolutely untrue, she contacted me first.
3. 26:11 - 30:44 **Cannot Watch**
## Final Parts
1. 30:44 - 31:30
	1. Repeating, I have never "held on" to CSAM, and I absolutely have not "over the span of my entire career" been defending the sexualizing of any minors.
2. 31:30 - 33:32 **Irrelevant, don't watch**
3. 33:32 - 34:57
	1. Attracted to 15 year old's? Long history of child predator?
		1. [41:04 - 41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-sbveUVSUc&t=2463s) RIP to Ethan's dad, then.
## Conclusion
I don't think Ethan is a pedophile; well, I'm like 85% sure he's not a pedophile. I don't even think Ethan thinks I'm a pedophile, based on his own recounting of the story's he's told about me. I have no idea if he's just desperate to lose the "Destiny's puppet" allegations or what, but the idea that he would just rehash the same old accusations about me over and over again in the middle of everything else going on right now is ridiculous. I have no idea if he's going to continue to make these sorts of videos about me or what, but it seems so stupid to give all of the anti-fan communities exactly what they want simply to rehash snark posts about each other, to each other, over and over again in public until we're both worn out from it.
