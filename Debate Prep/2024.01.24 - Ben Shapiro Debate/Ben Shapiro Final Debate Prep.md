It's important to acknowledge that both sides want an American government that enables us to live happy, healthy and productive lives.

Conservatives tend to think that enabling individuals with maximum freedom and minimum administrative burden enables them to do so, e.g. a person who's rights are secured by the government with taxation and bureaucracy kept at a minimum is best able to utilize his talent and work, if he so chooses, to accomplish whatever he wants. They value community driven efforts, like churches, to allow more local, democratic contribution of funds and distribution of help to people in the community who need it.

Liberals tend to think that opportunities made available to people allow them to flourish, and that some supportive government systems along with a more equitable burden of taxation allows for more people to flourish, e.g. a person who's minimum needs are met with some government assistance is better able to utilize his talent and work, if he's empowered, to accomplish whatever he wants. They value data driven, government policy distribution to collect tax funds and redistribute them in ways that minimize burden to wealthy people and maximize assistance to more needy people in a broader sense across the country.

I believe we need a bit more on the liberal side of effective redistribution, especially in areas of housing, food and education, to ensure that our population is as productive as possible.
