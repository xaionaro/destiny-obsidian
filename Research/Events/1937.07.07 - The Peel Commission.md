# Location
- Concerning Mandatory Palestine
# Causes
- Appointed by the UK government, this was a British Royal Commission of Inquiry headed by [[Earl Peel 1|Lord Peel]], who’s job was to investigate the conflict in Mandatory Palestine following the six-month-long Arab general strike.
# Facts
- The Commission explored what was happening in Mandatory Palestine and found that Arabs and Jews were bitterly divided over what to do with the land.
- Though Arabs benefited from the increase in Jewish productivity in the land, this has no positive impact on the two groups working together.
- This was the first time partition was formally recommended.
# Outcome
- In 1938 the [[Woodhead Commission]] was appointed to examine the report in detail to recommend an actual partition plan.
