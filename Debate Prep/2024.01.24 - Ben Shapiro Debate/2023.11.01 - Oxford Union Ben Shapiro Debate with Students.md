- Q: How do you excuse or explain the violence in the West Bank preceding October 7th
	- A: A breakaway group from the Palestinian Authority called "[Lions Den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions%27_Den_(militant_group))" are responsible for many terrorist attacks from Jerusalem and through the West Bank.
	- Islamic Jihad is a terrorist group with wide presence in the West Bank.
- My Questions
	- Does Shapiro believe all violence in the West Bank against Palestinians is justified? Is it always while targeting a terror cell?
	- Does Shapiro believe the IDF ever commits indiscriminate violence against Palestinians in the West Bank?
	- Does Shapiro believe in unjustified Settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank?
- Q: What do you think about IDF enacted violence against the [March of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_Gaza_border_protests)?
	- A: Ben isn't familiar.
- Q: Do you think the IDF shoots at civilians with total impunity?
	- A: That's not true, many of them have been arrested. "They're all currently sitting in Israeli jail."
- My Questions
	- Do you believe the IDF or Settlers are generally held accountable when it comes to committing violence against Palestinians?
		- What about the pardons given to the perpetrators of the [Kafr Qasim massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Qasim_massacre)?
- Q: Do you think Israel is justified in killing civilians using your logic?
	- A: There is a difference between going in and deliberately killing civilians vs attacking infrastructure and killing civilians through collateral damage.

- Q: A question about the political climate in the United States.
	- A: "We should nominate somebody who's sane...on one hand, we have a geriatric old guy, on the other hand, we have Donald Trump."
- My Questions
	- If we were truly looking to nominate someone based on their sanity, do we feel like Donald Trump's behavior is truly a better reflection of sanity than Joseph Biden's?
- Q: Why not support Biden over Trump? Trump's call for a suspension of the Constitution and Trump's incitement of January 6th.
	- A: In Trump's imagination, he's a serious threat to Democracy, but since Democracy survived he must not have been a serious threat.
	- A; January 6th was not a threat to American Democracy. There is no point in time on January 6th that a military coup had been launched and that Donald Trump would retain the presidency.
	- A: Joe Biden has used the power of the executive branch in new and exorbitant ways. For example, when he tried to use OSHA to enforce vaccination policies.
	- A: "I think Donald Trump only cares about Donald Trump."
	- A: Joe Biden doesn't believe in the Supreme Court. He's attacked the Supreme Court with alacrity. His party has talked about packing the Supreme Court.
- My Questions
	- Does someone need to always have a clear chance at thwarting Democracy to be considered a threat to Democracy? Does a failure to be anti-Democratic mean that you are, by definition Democratic?
	- During Jan 6th, is it inconceivable that a few more people could have caused substantial damage to the actual members of government? Were protestors at one point not a single hallway away from lawmakers? What would have happened if they were caught? Did Trump's constant election denialism not fuel this riot?
	- Did Donald Trump not flex incredibly executive power? What about in regards to restricting immigration, enacting tariffs, doing border policy, doing executive actions, etc..?
	- Isn't Donald Trump's obsession with himself a danger to all of us when he's supposed to be representing the American people instead of his own ego?
	- The Democrats literally lost a Supreme Court pick to the Republicans. Biden has [explicitly refused](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/13/923213582/biden-says-hes-not-a-fan-of-expanding-the-supreme-court) to consider packing the Supreme Court.
