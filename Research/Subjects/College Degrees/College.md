### Quick Facts for College Degree Worth
- Bachelor's degree holders enjoy significant lifetime earnings premiums, even when accounting for those who fail to complete their degrees and using discounted present dollar value.
	- Men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with bachelor's degrees earn $630,000 more. Men with graduate degrees earn $1.5 million more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with graduate degrees earn $1.1 million more.
	- Applying a 4 percent annual real discount rate, the net present lifetime value at age 20 of a bachelor's degree relative to a high school diploma is $260,000 for men and $180,000 for women. For those with a graduate degree, it is $400,000 for men and $310,000 for women.
- Even getting an Arts degree confers a decent wage premium (25%) over just high school work.
- People who graduate college may have issues with underemployment, but they still enjoy significant wage premiums even when taking that into account.
