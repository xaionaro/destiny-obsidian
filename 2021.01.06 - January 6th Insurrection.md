## Undermining The Electoral Process
Donald Trump made statements about the election being rigged even prior to his 2016 election, and continually called for the complete and total ban on mail-in ballots. ABC News [catalogued](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-things-rigged-rigged/story?id=42738506) a lot of the false election claims, and I've included some below.
### 2012 Election
- On November 6th, 2012, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266034630820507648) that people should "march on Washington" to protest the election results. A few minutes later, he [claimed](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266035509162303492) that America "is not a democracy."
### 2016 Election
- In February 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rM9lYDwseo) that Ted Cruz's campaign rigged the Iowa Caucus.
- On April 16th, 2016, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/721307257472999424) that the Republican primaries were rigged and boss controlled. On that [appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mk2M3-MCQw) that he references, he goes on to speak about how delegates are just bribed and paid off to vote for certain candidates.
- On August 1st, 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU3z7iFIalY&t=440s) the last election in 2012 was rigged, and claims with certainty that the 2016 election on November 8th is going to be rigged, and that Republicans "better be careful."
- In October 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video) they were trying to rig the election at the polling booths, saying dead people were voting, illegal immigrants were voting, and that they were fighting in a rigged election.
- On November 27th, 2016, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664) that he would have won the popular vote against Hillary "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."

From May 11th, 2017 to January 3rd, 2018, Trump created the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity, also known as the Voter Fraud Commission. It requested an unusually invasive amount of voter data from the states, but all 50 states refused to comply. After Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed a lawsuit against the Republican members of the Commission for not sharing documents or scheduling information, the commission was disbanded by Trump. The Commission was not able to find any evidence of voter fraud.
### 2020 Election
- On April 7th, 2020, Donald Trump [claims](https://x.com/MSNBC/status/1247658663617138691) that there is voter fraud in the form of people filling out multiple ballots and dumping ballots for Trump, after claiming mail-in voting was okay when he did it, but not when other people do it.
- On May 20th, 2024, Donald Trump [answered](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-governor-hutchinson-arkansas-governor-kelly-kansas/) in a press briefing that "thousands and thousands" of mail-in ballots were fraudulently filled out.
- On May 24th, 2020, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264558926021959680) that the United States "cannot have Mail in Ballots," saying it would be the "greatest Rigged Election in history."
- On August 24th, 2020, Donald trump [states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWVVDKK3H8&t=1255s) that the only way they can lose the election is if it's rigged and someone takes it from us.
- On September 23rd, 2020, Donald Trump [would not commit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR8oIitE6mI) to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming that the mail-in ballots were fraudulent and out of control.
- On September 29th, 2020, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHysqu3gnSc&t=180s) that mail-in ballots being sent out pre-emptively were all fraudulently done by the Democrats, and that Americans were going to see a "fraud like you've never seen." He also claims that "we won't know for months" for the counting of the mail-in ballots.

10 states [allowed](https://ballotpedia.org/Early_voting_dates,_2020) early voting via mail in September. Donald Trump was making multiple claims of voter fraud via mail-in ballots, which Democrats [were known](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/11/20/the-voting-experience-in-2020/) to utilize in greater numbers than Republicans, despite Trump having absolutely no evidence of said voter fraud and despite  counting having not even yet begun and no numbers being published. Trump also fluidly switches between definitions when he claims the election was "rigged," meaning it could be officials rigging polls, ballot boxes being stuffed, ballots being not counted, boxes being tossed, vote totals being changed, etc...etc...

It's important to note that while Donald Trump claims ahead of time that voter fraud would be rampant in 2020, he never actually gives a way to make mail-in ballots more secure, he simply advocates for the elimination of them altogether, repeatedly, because he knows they will favor Democratic voters. Some politicians, like Bernie Sanders, literally [predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LIb7xNL9Sc) (on October 23rd, 2020) the exact outcome of election night because it was already known that mail-in ballots might take a bit longer to count and they would likely dramatically favor Democrats. Sanders even predicted Trump trying to end the voting early.

Donald Trump attempted to call the election early, on the night of, despite [everyone across the nation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/01/why-itll-be-normal-if-results-shift-in-the-days-after-the-election) knowing it would take some time to count the incoming mail-in ballots. He also falsely claims he won many states by margins that were impossible to be overcome, despite this being completely untrue, and continues to call the mail-in ballots fraudulent, claiming that he already won the election. On November 5th, the next morning, he went as far as to [tweet](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324353932022480896) "STOP THE COUNT!" so he wouldn't lose his majority. A [leaked audio recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxNoUnxN_cs) from October 31st, 2020, of Steve Bannon shows him speaking about Trump's plan to call the election early.
