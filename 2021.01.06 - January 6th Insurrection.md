## Undermining The Electoral Process
Donald Trump made statements about the election being rigged even prior to his 2016 election, and continually called for the complete and total ban on mail-in ballots. ABC News [catalogued](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-things-rigged-rigged/story?id=42738506) a lot of the false election claims, and I've included some below.
### Foreknowledge of Disparate Attitudes Towards Mail-in Voting
10 states [allowed](https://ballotpedia.org/Early_voting_dates,_2020) early voting via mail as early as September for the 2020 election. Donald Trump was making multiple claims of voter fraud via mail-in ballots, which Democrats [were known](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/11/20/the-voting-experience-in-2020/) to utilize in greater numbers than Republicans, despite Trump having absolutely no evidence of said voter fraud and despite  counting having not even yet begun and no numbers being published. 

>[!quote]- [*Dominion v Fox News*](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dominion-Complaint-Fox.pdf) pages 18-19
> Not surprisingly, given these trends, the head of the Fox News Decision Desk correctly predicted that “on election night, we may be looking at states where it seems that President Trump is in the lead, but there’s still 20 or 30 percent of the vote outstanding … so we’re not [going to be] able to make the call in those states." He correctly recognized—and Fox widely and repeatedly reported before the election—that this would occur because President Trump had criticized mail-in voting and encouraged Republicans to vote in person whereas Democrats had encouraged their supporters to vote by mail. In fact, Maria Bartiromo discussed this very phenomenon with President Trump in an October 11, 2020 interview, with President Trump lamenting that mail-in votes would likely be counted “two weeks after the vote comes in,” and stating that “Republicans are going out to vote—they don’t want to do the [mail-in] ballot thing, they don’t trust it. Republicans are going out to vote.”

Fox News was also complicit in the process, helping Trump fabricate and prepare to push lies in the event that he lost the election.

>[!quote]- The Daily Beast, [*Fox News Pushes ‘Brain Room’ to Find Evidence for Trump’s Voter Fraud Claims, Insiders Say*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-pushing-brain-room-to-lend-credibility-to-trumps-voter-fraud-paranoia-insiders-say) on October 31st, 2020
> “Officially, it looks like an attempt to report on election irregularities. What it feels like is an attempt to push more baseless conspiracy theories and scare the viewers into thinking the election is being ‘stolen.’ It isn’t,” one Fox News veteran with direct knowledge of the Election Integrity Project, told The Daily Beast. “It’s alarming that the Brain Room is a part of this, like it’s an attempt to give it an air of legitimacy. I don’t recall ever seeing anything like this before.”
> 
> This person added: “It feels like an attempt to use the Brain Room to try to lend credibility to something that isn’t credible. It feels like a stunt to support Trump’s baseless allegations that the Democrats are trying to ‘steal’ the election. If it is a collection or database of alleged voter fraud examples, I could see it being used to support Trump’s efforts to contest the election results, if Biden wins.”
> 
> A second Fox News staffer—who, like other current employees quoted in this story, asked not to be further identified for fear of retaliation—said the Election Integrity Project “seems a logical effort to collect information about mail-in ballots that could skew the results… Fox clearly wants to portray mailed-in ballots in the most negative light, since Democrats favor it and Trump’s re-election, if polls are to be believed this time around, is not at all a foregone conclusion. He and GOP leaders are promoting doubt about the system, which arguably has its flaws, and of course Fox serves as a force multiplier to their narratives.”

Some politicians, like Bernie Sanders, literally [predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LIb7xNL9Sc) (on October 23rd, 2020) the exact outcome of election night because it was already known that mail-in ballots might take a bit longer to count and they would likely dramatically favor Democrats. Sanders even predicted Trump trying to end the voting early.

 A [leaked audio recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxNoUnxN_cs) from October 31st, 2020, of Steve Bannon shows him speaking about Trump's plan to call the election early.
### 2012 Election
- On November 6th, 2012, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266034630820507648) that people should "march on Washington" to protest the election results. A few minutes later, he [claimed](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266035509162303492) that America "is not a democracy."
### 2016 Election
- In February 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rM9lYDwseo) that Ted Cruz's campaign rigged the Iowa Caucus.
- On April 16th, 2016, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/721307257472999424) that the Republican primaries were rigged and boss controlled. On that [appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mk2M3-MCQw) that he references, he goes on to speak about how delegates are just bribed and paid off to vote for certain candidates.
- On August 1st, 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU3z7iFIalY&t=440s) the last election in 2012 was rigged, and claims with certainty that the 2016 election on November 8th is going to be rigged, and that Republicans "better be careful."
- In October 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video) they were trying to rig the election at the polling booths, saying dead people were voting, illegal immigrants were voting, and that they were fighting in a rigged election.
- On November 27th, 2016, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664) that he would have won the popular vote against Hillary "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."

From May 11th, 2017 to January 3rd, 2018, Trump created the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity, also known as the Voter Fraud Commission. It requested an unusually invasive amount of voter data from the states, but all 50 states refused to comply. After Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed a lawsuit against the Republican members of the Commission for not sharing documents or scheduling information, the commission was disbanded by Trump. The Commission was not able to find any evidence of voter fraud.
### 2020 Election
- On April 7th, 2020, Donald Trump [claims](https://x.com/MSNBC/status/1247658663617138691) that there is voter fraud in the form of people filling out multiple ballots and dumping ballots for Trump, after claiming mail-in voting was okay when he did it, but not when other people do it.
- On May 20th, 2024, Donald Trump [answered](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-governor-hutchinson-arkansas-governor-kelly-kansas/) in a press briefing that "thousands and thousands" of mail-in ballots were fraudulently filled out.
- On May 24th, 2020, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264558926021959680) that the United States "cannot have Mail in Ballots," saying it would be the "greatest Rigged Election in history."
- On August 24th, 2020, Donald trump [states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWVVDKK3H8&t=1255s) that the only way they can lose the election is if it's rigged and someone takes it from us.
- On September 23rd, 2020, Donald Trump [would not commit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR8oIitE6mI) to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming that the mail-in ballots were fraudulent and out of control.
- On September 29th, 2020, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHysqu3gnSc&t=180s) that mail-in ballots being sent out pre-emptively were all fraudulently done by the Democrats, and that Americans were going to see a "fraud like you've never seen." He also claims that "we won't know for months" for the counting of the mail-in ballots.

Trump fluidly switched between definitions when he claimed the election was "rigged," meaning it could be officials rigging polls, ballot boxes being stuffed, ballots being not counted, boxes being tossed, vote totals being changed, etc...etc...

It's important to note that while Donald Trump claims ahead of time that voter fraud would be rampant in 2020, he never actually gives a way to make mail-in ballots more secure, he simply advocates for the elimination of them altogether, repeatedly, because he knows they will favor Democratic voters. 

Donald Trump attempted to call the election early, on the night of, despite [everyone across the nation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/01/why-itll-be-normal-if-results-shift-in-the-days-after-the-election) knowing it would take some time to count the incoming mail-in ballots. He also falsely claimed he won many states by margins that were impossible to be overcome, despite it having been completely untrue, and continues to call the mail-in ballots fraudulent, claiming that he already won the election. On November 5th, the next morning, he went as far as to [tweet](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324353932022480896) "STOP THE COUNT!" so he wouldn't lose his majority.
### *Dominion v. Fox News*
In June of 2021, Dominion [filed a complaint](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23731963-dominion_3-21-23_hearing_slides-used-at-hearing_redacted ) against Fox News, alleging that the company engaged in a widespread campaign of defamatory behavior towards Dominion in order to salvage its reputation among conservative media listeners. Dominion's lawsuit accused Fox of lying on four separate claims:
1. Dominion committed election fraud by rigging the 2020 Presidential Election
2. Dominion’s software and algorithms manipulated vote counts in the 2020 Presidential Election
3. Dominion is owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for the dictator Hugo Chávez; and
4. Dominion paid kickbacks to government officials who used its machines in the 2020 Presidential Election.

Factual Allegations
- Dominion was established in 2002 by CEO John Poulos and procured its first contract with New York state in July 2009. 
- After it became clear that Trump would lose into the election, on November 6th, Donald Trump began to complain that his lead had "mysteriously disappeared."
- On November 7th, Fox projected Trump had lost the election.
- On November 8th, Fox invited Sidney Powell onto the *Sunday Morning Futures* show to discuss Dominion voting fraud.
	- Powell declared that there was “a massive and coordinated effort to steal this election from We the People of the United States of America, to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, to manufacture votes for Joe Biden.” 
- ...more to the [complaint](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dominion-Complaint-Fox.pdf), I don't have time to read through all of this right now, though.

Dominion's [motion for summary judgement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23731963-dominion_3-21-23_hearing_slides-used-at-hearing_redacted) contains many damming emails showing that Fox News was knowingly capitalizing on fraudulent election claims to win back their audience after election night

## Election Night
The election occurred on November 3rd and went as everyone predicted, with Donald Trump initially having a large lead and then slowly losing it as mail-in ballots were counted as the night progressed.

At 11:20 PM, Fox News [called Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/us/politics/trump-fox-news-arizona.html) for Joe Biden, sending Donald Trump and his team into a fury. Jason Miller [tweeted out](https://x.com/JasonMillerinDC/status/1323849305917186050), admonishing Fox News for calling the election early. Jared Kushner was also in contact with Rupert Murdoch as the night went on. At 2:30 AM the following morning, Trump told supporters "[this is a fraud on the American public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duE8tnrSmNc&t=442s)." Trump said he wanted to go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of ballots, then declared himself the winner of the election. Pence went up on stage afterwards, contradicting Trump and saying that, while he was sure they'd won the election, he would wait until every vote was counted.
## Legal Challenges
In July of 2022, a collection of 8 different conservative judges, politicians and analysts [published](https://lostnotstolen.org//wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lost-Not-Stolen-The-Conservative-Case-that-Trump-Lost-and-Biden-Won-the-2020-Presidential-Election-July-2022.pdf) a report called "LOST, NOT STOLEN: The Conservative Case that Trump Lost and Biden Won the 2020 Presidential Election."  In the report, they go through all 64 cases that the Trump campaign put forth to Judges, claiming that every case was without merit and affirming the results of the 2020 election.

>[!quote]- LOST, NOT STOLEN, page 4
>We therefore have undertaken an examination of every claim of fraud and miscount put forward by former President Trump and his advocates, and now put the results of those investigations before the American people, and especially before fellow conservatives who may be uncertain about what and whom to believe. Our conclusion is unequivocal: Joe Biden was the choice of a majority of the Electors, who themselves were the choice of the majority of voters in their states.
### The Trump Campaign's Court Cases
Quoting from LOST, NOT STOLEN:

"Of the 64 cases brought by Trump and his supporters, twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits, and 30 cases included a hearing on the merits. Only in one Pennsylvania case involving far too few votes to overturn the results did Trump and his supporters prevail."
### Other Court Cases
### 2000 Mules
On May 20th, 2022, well known far right conspiracy theorist Dinesh D'Souza published a film called "2000 Mules," where they alleged, with no solid evidence, that Democrats had organized a sophisticated system of ballot harvesting across several states.

In October of 2022, Atlanta citizen Mark Andrews filed lawsuits for defamation, conspiracy and intrusion on seclusion. A state investigation found that he had not committed any of the crimes alleged about him in the film, and on May 31st, 2024, Salem Media Group settled with Andrews, [releasing a public apology](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/31/g-s1-2298/publisher-of-2000-mules-election-conspiracy-theory-film-issues-apology) and taking down the film and book.
## Trump's Calls States to Change Votes
### Donald Trump's January 2nd, 2021 Call to Brad Raffensperger
(Trump made [a phone call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6qnhMUVVGo) to the Election Investigator Frances Watson on December 23, 2020, repeating a lot of the false claims he'll go on to repeat to Raffensperger later on.)

On January 2nd, 2024, Donald Trump (joined by trade advisor Peter Navarro, Justice Department official John Lott, law professor John C. Eastman, and attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Cleta Mitchell, Alex Kaufman, Kurt Hilbert, and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows) [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW_Bdf_jGaA)  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (joined by Raffensperger's chief of staff Jordan Fuchs and general counsel Ryan Germany) to discuss finding enough votes to win the election.

Trump claimed, with no evidence, that:
1. there were hundreds of thousands of signature forgeries
2. that 50's of thousands of people had already been voted for
3. 4,502 people voted who were not on the voter registration roll
4. 18,000 people voted with vacant addresses
5. 900 voters who used a PO Box number
6. at least 18,000 voters counted multiple times by **Ruby Freeman**
7. the water main breaking disrupted the vote process for malfeasance
8. that boxes of faked votes were brought in to be counted
9. more and more dumb claims with absolutely zero evidence cited.

Trump continued to make accusations during the call, dismissing claims that he was simply getting these accusations from social media by countering that they were actually coming from "Trump media." He also accuses Raffensperger of being criminally liable for not finding enough votes for Trump because they must have known about the voter fraud, and says that it would be a "big risk" for both of them if they weren't able to flip the election in favor of Trump.

Trump says to Raffensperger: "I think it's very dangerous for you to say that \[there's no criminality\]." and alludes to him engaging in criminal behavior many times during the call.

Multiple times on the call Donald Trump implies that he will refuse to help in the future elections if Raffensperger won't acquiesce to his demands for 11,000 votes. "I need 11,000 votes give me a break."

Trump's campaign launched lawsuits against the state to contest the results, but ended up [voluntarily dismissing](https://sos.ga.gov/news/trump-legal-team-folds) it the day before court.

>There are four documents, however, in which Dr. Eastman and other attorneys suggest that—irrespective of the merits—the primary goal of filing is to delay or otherwise disrupt the January 6 vote. In one email, for example, President Trump’s attorneys state that “\[m]erely having this case pending in the Supreme Court, not ruled on, might be enough to delay consideration of Georgia.” This email, read in context with other documents in this review, make clear that President Trump filed certain lawsuits not to obtain legal relief, but to disrupt or delay the January 6 congressional proceedings through the courts. The Court finds that these four documents are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of the obstruction crime. Accordingly, the crime-fraud exception applies, and the Court ORDERS Dr. Eastman to disclose the four documents...

>On December 4, 2020, President Trump and his attorneys alleged in a Georgia state court action that Fulton County improperly counted a number of votes including 10,315 deceased people, 2,560 felons, and 2,423 unregistered voters.69 President Trump and his attorneys then decided to contest the state court proceeding in federal court, and discussed incorporating by reference the voter fraud numbers alleged in the state petition. On December 30, 2020, Dr. Eastman relayed “concerns” from President Trump’s team “about including specific numbers in the paragraph dealing with felons, deceased, moved, etc.” The attorneys continued to discuss the President’s resistance to signing “when specific numbers were included.” As Dr. Eastman explained the next day:
>
>"Although the President signed a verification for \[the state court filing] back on Dec. 1, he has since been made aware that some of the allegations (and evidence proffered by the experts) has been inaccurate. For him to sign a new verification with that knowledge (and incorporation by reference) would not be accurate."
>
>President Trump and his attorneys ultimately filed the complaint with the same inaccurate numbers without rectifying, clarifying, or otherwise changing them. President Trump, moreover, signed a verification swearing under oath that the incorporated, inaccurate numbers “are true and correct” or “believed to be true and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief.
>
>The emails show that President Trump knew that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and to the public. The Court finds that these emails are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud the United States.


### People Who Told Trump he Lost
1. All of these people were trusted by Trump to investigate claims of election fraud:
	1. Bill Stepien, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's National Field Director</span> for his campaign, a lifelong Republican, who also worked on Giuliana's presidential campaign in 2007-2008, told Trump he had lost on election night.
	2. Chris Miller, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's Director of the National Counterterrorism Center</span>, attested that Matt Oczkowski, Trump's campaign's top data scientist, told him on election night that he was going to lose.
	3. William Barr, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's Attorney General of the Department of Justice</span>, told Trump repeatedly that he'd investigated and found absolutely no signs of voter fraud.
	4. Jeffry Rosen, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's acting Attorney General of the Department of Justice</span>, called or met with Trump almost every day to tell him there was no election fraud.
	5. Richard Donoghue, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's acting deputy attorney general</span>, told Trump the information he was getting was false.
	6. Chris Stirewalt, <span style="color:#0070c0">former Fox New political editor</span>, said that Trump had no chance of winning the election after the votes were counted.
	7. Jason Miller, the <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump Campaign Senior Advisor</span>, informed Trump several times that there wasn't enough evidence of fraud to overturn the election.
		1. "When our research and campaign legal team can't back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we're 0-32 on our cases. I'll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership."
	8. Mike Pence, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's Vice President</span>, said there was never evidence of widespread fraud, and that he believed there was no good evidence of enough fraud to overturn the election.
	9. Matthew Morgan, the <span style="color:#0070c0">General Counsel of Trump's campaign</span>, claimed that the Trump staff, including him and Marc Short and Greg Jacob, didn't believe there was sufficient evidence of voter fraud.
	10. Brad Raffensperger, the <span style="color:#0070c0">Republican Georgia Secretary of State</span>, denied every single claim that Trump made about election Fraud.
	11. Brian Kemp, the <span style="color:#0070c0">Republican Governor of Georgia</span>, denied that the election was stolen in Georgia.
	12. A <span style="color:#0070c0">group of prominent Republicans</span> (4 Federal Judges, 2 former Senators, a lawyer and someone who worked on Capitol Hill for 20 years) published a conservative report, titled Lost, Not Stolen, which claimed

The report concludes “that Donald Trump and his supporters had their day in court and failed to produce substantive evidence to make their case.” President Trump and his legal allies “failed because of a lack of evidence and not because of erroneous rulings or unfair judges . . . . In many cases, after making extravagant claims of wrongdoing, Trump’s legal representatives showed up in court or state proceedings empty-handed, and then returned to their rallies and media campaigns to repeat the same unsupported claims.”

One of those Trump nominees, Judge Stephanos Bibas of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejected an appeal by the Trump Campaign claiming that Pennsylvania officials “did not undertake any meaningful effort” to fight illegal absentee ballots and uneven treatment of voters across counties. Judge Bibas wrote in his decision that “calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Another Trump nominee, Judge Brett Ludwig of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, ruled against President Trump’s lawsuit alleging that the result was skewed by illegal procedures that governed drop boxes, ballot address information, and individuals who claimed“ indefinitely confined” status to vote from home.

## False Elector Scheme
### Kenneth Chesebro's Initial Memos
Kenneth Chesebro was an attorney from Wisconsin who began working with the Trump campaign at the behest of Jim Troupis, another lawyer for Trump's campaign, around November 9th, 2020. He was responsible for the creation of the first few memos outlining a potential scheme that Trump could utilize to challenge the certification of the electoral vote on January 6th.

Chesebro believed that if people gathered and falsely attested to being legitimate state electors and transmitted said votes on December 14th to Congress (and NARA) that it would keep Trump's chances alive to win the election should a court rule in his favor from between December 14th, the date that the electors in all 50 states certified their votes for president, and January 6th, the date that Congress was scheduled to count the electorate slates.

Ultimately there were 7 different states whom were selected to send false slates of electorates out from, here are those states and the accompanying state laws that dictate how slates of electors are legally supposed to be chosen:

1. Arizona
	1. Arizona law [states]((https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00212.htm):
		1. A. On the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1956, and quadrennially thereafter, there shall be elected a number of presidential electors equal to the number of United States senators and representatives in Congress from this state.
		2. B. After the secretary of state issues the statewide canvass containing the results of a presidential election, the presidential electors of this state shall cast their electoral college votes for the candidate for president and the candidate for vice president who jointly received the highest number of votes in this state as prescribed in the canvass.
	2. The [false Arizona slate of electors](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/az-full-1.pdf) were not elected and did not cast their ballots in concordance with the popular vote reported by the state.
2. Georgia
	1. Georgia laws [states]():
		1. The presidential electors chosen pursuant to Code Section 21-2-10 shall assemble at the seat of government of this state at 12:00 Noon of the day which is, or may be, directed by the Congress of the United States and shall then and there perform the duties required of them by the Constitution and laws of the United States.
	2. The [false electors](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/ga-full.pdf) did not meat in the seat of government, and were not chosen by the state legislature.
3. Michigan
	1. Michigan law [states](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Laws/MCL?objectName=mcl-168-47):
		1. The electors of President and Vice President shall convene in the senate chamber at the capitol of this state at 2 p.m., eastern standard time, on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December following the elector's election. At any time before receiving the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors from the governor or within 48 hours thereafter, an elector may resign by submitting the elector's written and verified resignation to the governor...
	2. The [false slates](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/mi-full.pdf) didn't meet in the senate chambers in the capitol.
4. Nevada
	1. Nevada law [states]():
		1. The Secretary of State shall preside at the meeting of presidential electors held pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 7. Except as otherwise provided in this section and [NRS 298.075](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-298.html#NRS298Sec075), the nominees for presidential elector whose candidates for President and Vice President receive the highest number of votes in this State at the general election are the presidential electors.
	2. The Secretary of State was obviously not present when the [Nevada false electors](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/nv-full.pdf) certified and transmitted their vote.
5. Pennsylvania
	1. Pennsylvania law [states]():
		1. The electors chosen, as aforesaid, shall assemble at the seat of government of this Commonwealth, at 12 o'clock noon of the day which is, or may be, directed by the Congress of the United States, and shall then and there perform the duties enjoined upon them by the Constitution and laws of the United States.
	2. The [false slates](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/pa-cov-full.pdf) didn't meet at the seat of government.
6. Wisconsin
	1. Wisconsin law [states](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/7/ii/75):
		1. The electors for president and vice president shall meet at the state capitol following the presidential election at 12:00 noon the first Monday after the 2nd Wednesday in December.
	2. The [false electors](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/wi-full.pdf) were not able to meet in the state capitol.
7. New Mexico
	1. New Mexico law [states](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/chapter-1/article-15/section-1-15-3/):
		1. B. The presidential electors shall be nominated by the state convention according to the rules of that party on file with the secretary of state.
		2. C. Upon the nomination of presidential electors, the chair and secretary of the convention shall certify the names and addresses of the nominees not less than sixty-three days prior to the election to the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall record the nominees' names in the secretary's office as the presidential elector nominees of that party.
	2. The [false electors](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/nm-full.pdf) were not nominated by the state convention, nor did the chair or secretary of the convention certify the names and addresses of the nominees.

>[!quote]- [January 6th Select Committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf), page 378
>
>On December 14th, using instructions provided by Chesebro, the fake Trump electors gathered and participated in signing ceremonies in all seven States. In five of these States—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin—the certificates they signed used the language that falsely declared themselves to be “the duly elected and qualified Electors” from their State. This declaration was false because none of the signatories had been granted that official status by their State government in the form of a certificate of ascertainment.
>
>The paperwork signed by the fake Trump electors in two other States contained partial caveats. In New Mexico, the document they signed made clear that they were participating “on the Understanding that it might later be determined that we are the duly elected and qualified Electors. . . .” In Pennsylvania, the document they signed indicated that they were participating “on the understanding that if, as a result of a final non-appealable Court Order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified Electors. . . .”

Even Chesebro admitted his plan was dicey at best in his [December 9th Memo](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/02/us/trump-electors-memo-december.html):

"In conclusion, it appears that voting by an alternate slate of electors is unproblematic in Arizona and Wisconsin; slightly problematic in Michigan (requiring access to the senate chamber);  somewhat dicey in Georgia and Pennsylvania in the event that one or more electors don't attend (require gubernatorial ratification of alternates); and very problematic in Nevada (given the role accorded to the Secretary of State)."

On December 13th, Chesebro [lays out](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-Chapman004708/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-Chapman004708.pdf) to Eastman how Pence could declare the ECA unconstitutional and disrupt the expected electoral vote count proceeding to allow Trump to win the election. He says that Pence should break from the stated procedures of the Electoral Count Act, claiming it to be unconstitutional (in violation of the 12th amendment). Once Pence has recused himself from his role in the senate, some other Republican leader will take over and act "confused" about how to read which slate of electors is legitimate.

"He then opens the two envelopes from Arizona, and announces that he cannot and will not, at least as of that date, count any electoral votes from Arizona because there are two slates of votes, and it is clear that the Arizona courts did not give a full and fair opportunity for review of election irregularities, in violation of due process."

Chesebro would then go on to outline ways in which the states contesting their electoral votes being counted could recertify new electoral slates in the future, either by "rerunning the election, or engaging in adequate judicial review, or having its legislature appoint electors."

>[!quote]- Chesebro's December 13th Memo
>If the Court were to dodge, then we would have a situation similar to 1877, in which the parties would realize that if they remained at loggerheads, with the President of the Senate perhaps refusing to open the votes of the contested states as long as his authority to count the votes was being challenged, and Pelosi refusing to hold an election for president in the House, and with January 20 looming, political leaders would face a choice. Either Pelosi would become acting president on January 20 (after resigning as Speaker) or the Senate would reelect Pence as Vice President, who would then become acting president on Jan. 20.
>
>In this situation, which would seem messy and unpalatable to many,with renewed attention on the election abuses, and with several states controlled by Republican legislators faced with perhaps not being counted in the Electoral College, it doesn't seem fanciful to think that Trump and Pence would end up winning the vote after some legislatures appoint electors, or else that there might be a negotiated solution in which the Senate elects Pence Vice President, and Trump agrees to drop his bid to be elected in the House, so that Biden and Harris are defeated, even though Trump isn't reelected.
>
>Any of the outcomes sketched above seems preferable to allowing the Electoral Count Act to operate by its terms, with Vice President Pence being forced to preside over a charade in which Biden and Harris are declared the winner of an election in which none of the serious abuses that occurred were ever examined with due deliberation.

Chesebro's [secret Twitter account](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107181652/https:/twitter.com/BadgerPundit/status/1325140117497896966) was [leaked](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/politics/kenneth-chesebro-secret-twitter-account-kfile/index.html) in which he'd made [multiple](https://imgur.com/a/Jc2l3UU) [tweets](https://x.com/BlueATLGeorgia/status/1762175606312116667) detailing how Trump could win the election via Pence overturning the vote while the electoral votes were being counted.
### Donald Trump's Direct Involvement
On December 6th, Mark Meadows forwarded the November 18th Memo from Chesebro to Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Jason Miller. Meadows and Miller began to work to gather the 79 needed Republican electors on the November ballot in the 7 states they planned to have transmit false elector votes to Congress.

Trump Campaign Associate General Counsel Joshua Findlay told the January 6th Select Committee "“it was my understanding that the President made this decision" to pursue the electorate scheme by December 7th or 8th. Findlay claimed that the campaign's general counsel, Matthew Morgan directed the campaign lawyers to “look into electors in these potential litigation States."

In deposition testimony provided to the Jan 6th Committee, RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said that on or around December 12th, Trump, along with Eastman, called her to stress the importance of gathering alternate slates of electors.

>[!quote]- RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney, [J6 Report deposition](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000915972/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000915972.pdf), page 9
>So to the best of my recollection, and again it's a long time ago, he 8 introduced me to John Eastman, I was not familiar with him at the time. So I vaguely 9 remember him mentioning that he was a professor, and then essentially he turned the 10 call over to Mr. Eastman, who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the RNC 11 helping the campaign gather these contingent electors in case any of the legal challenges 12 that were ongoing changed the result of any of the States. And so, that would fulfill the 13 requirement for the electors meeting if it went to the Supreme Court.

Testimony from Special Assistant to the President, Cassidy Hutchinson, also confirms that Trump knew of the legal dubiousness of this elector plot, especially after most of the lawsuit had failed by mid December and his legal staff on his campaign began to quit and distance themselves from the campaign:

"Committee Staff: \[T]o be clear, did you hear the White House Counsel’s Office say that this plan to have alternate electors meet and cast votes for Donald Trump in States that he had lost was not legally sound? 

Hutchinson: Yes, sir."
### Many Doubted Alternate Electors Legitimacy
From the [J6 Committee Report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf), page 378:

"Even so, 14 of the original Republicans who had been listed as electoral college nominees on the November ballot bowed out when the fake Trump electors gathered in December. Former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land declined to attend, which the State’s GOP chair, Laura Cox, told the Select Committee was because “I think she just said she was uncomfortable with the whole thing” and that she “has her own beliefs.” A senior advisor for the Pennsylvania GOP said that Chairman Tabas “did not serve as an elector because Joe Biden won the election and it was Biden’s electors that were certified.” Former U.S. Representative Tom Marino (R-PA) said he backed out because “I’m a constitutionalist,” and “as a former prosecutor, when the attorney general says that he’s not finding anything there, that’s good enough for me.” The other eleven dropouts included a Georgia State lawmaker, a former State party chair from New Mexico, two former State party chairs from Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania’s RNC national committeewoman.

Other participants asserted that they would have had much greater concerns if the Trump team had been more forthcoming about how the fake electoral votes would be used. The Trump Campaign’s director of election day operations in Georgia told the Select Committee that “I absolutely would not have” wanted to participate in organizing the Trump team’s fake electors in Georgia “had I known that the three main lawyers for the campaign that I’d spoken to in the past and were leading up were not on board.” He said he felt “angry” because “no one really cared if—if people were potentially putting themselves in jeopardy” by doing this, and “we were just . . .useful idiots or rubes at that point.”"
### The "Coup" Memos from Eastman
Eastman sent out two memos, [one on December 23rd](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/09/20/eastman.memo.pdf), and another one "war gaming the alternatives" [on January 3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/john-eastman-s-second-memo-on-january-6-scenario/b3fd2b0a-f931-4e0c-8bac-c82f13c2dd6f/), detailing how to get Pence to contradict the Electoral Count Act and either choose to count the false electors or force the house delegation, where the Republicans held a majority, to cast a vote for president (ideally choosing to reseat Donald Trump).
### Pressuring Mike Pence
On January 2nd, Pence went over the procedures of the certification of the election, as set out in the Electoral Count Act, with his counsel, Greg Jacob, Chief of Staff Marc Short, and the Trump Campaign's General Counsel Matt Morgan. Marc gave [a statement to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/03/politics/pence-republicans-congress-electoral-college/index.html) intending to clarify that the Vice President does not have the power to unilaterally change the election outcome, attempting to clarify as concisely as possible to the public as to the role of the Vice President on January 6th, and that only lawful objections to the election should be entertained.

On that same day, Steve Bannon's show, "Bannon's War Room," went live with [an episode](https://rumble.com/vcdhde-ep-625-new-year-old-fights-w-rudy-giuliani-boris-epshteyn-and-john-eastman.html) featuring Rudy Giuliani, Trump Campaign Strategic Advisor Boris Epshteyn , and John Eastman. They repeated many of the same false claims, both about voter fraud existing across multiple states, and Eastman continued to falsely assert that Pence has the authority to contravene the Electoral Count Act and subvert the expected process on January 6th to certify the election. He also claims that Congress can make a decision on their own about which slates of electors to accept, hoping that the states will accept all of the Republican slates due to the false claims that were continuing to be pushed concerning voter fraud. Eastman said that the outcome of the election comes down to the "courage and spine" of Mike Pence.

In his January 3rd Memo, where Eastman goes over several ways for Trump to remain president, he makes it clear that the only way Trump can possibly steal the election is if Pence acts in a way contrary to the ECA.

On January 4th, Trump and Eastman hold a meeting with Pence to pressure him to throw out the election. During the meeting, Eastman acknowledges that there are several foundational problems with the plan: the plan violates the Electoral Count Act which calls for all vote certificates to be "acted upon," with objections being "finally disposed of," whereas Eastman wanted Pence to set these aside and not resolve them. Secondly, the plot called for an extended break, when the ECA only specified two very short breaks to verify the submitted votes. Third and finally, the alternate slates of electors were not legitimate, as they had received no certificates of ascertainments from any state governors and no state legislatures were willing to go along with their plot. Pence found the arguments unconvincing, and was steadfast in his adherence to his proper role for January 6th.

On the night of January 4th, Trump began to ramp up the public pressure against Pence, calling for him to "come through for us" in a Georgia rally.

>[!quote]- Donald Trump in a January 4th, 2021 [Georgia Rally](https://www.youtube.com/live/9HisWmJJ3oE?si=dGAbsdKVie1FD3C7&t=6820)
>I think a lot of you despise them as you know there’s nothing the radical Democrats will not do to get power that they so desperately crave. Even the outright stealing of elections, like they’re trying to do with us. We’re not going to let it happen over the pass, and I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. I hope that our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much. No, Mike is a great guy. He’s a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot, but he’s going to have a lot to say about it. One thing with him, you’re going to get straight shots. He’s going to call it straight.

On January 5th, another meeting was between Eastman and Greg Jacob and Marc Short. Jacob [recorded Eastman's request](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000070421/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000070421.pdf) that the Vice President needed to unilaterally reject the electors. Trump made [multiple tweets](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/tweets-january-5-2021) that morning, one claiming that two senators would join in his plot in the senate to "#stopthesteal", and another claiming that "The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors," applying more pressure to Pence.

At Trump's request, him and Pence had another meeting that same day. Although the J6 Committee was unable to inquire about the exact details of the meeting, Marc Short seems to suggest that it was concerning Trump requesting Pence once again toss the votes during the certification. That night, in response to a NYT article leaking the earlier conversation, Donald Trump put out [a statement](https://x.com/meredithllee/status/1346652403605647367?lang=en) containing multiple lies, the principle one being that him and Pence were "in total agreement" about what Pence could do on January 6th.

>[!quote]- Mike Pence on [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pence-rejects-crackpot-trump-lawyer-suggestion-paused-2020-electoral-vote-certification.amp), August 2nd, 2023
>
>"I had no right to overturn the election, and despite the fact that President Trump is continued to insist that, over the last two and a half years, I want people to know that I stood strong on the Constitution that day, by God's Grace, and I always will."
>
>"All they asked you to do was just take a pause that day."
>
>"I say that's completely false, and it's contrary to American history, to our Constitution, and to the laws of this country. I never considered it, Martha. Look, the first time when I heard the speculation that I, as the Vice President, had the authority to overturn the election by returning or rejecting votes, I frankly dismissed it out of hand. look, the founders of this country had just won a war of independence against a king. And I was confident as a student of American history that those founders would have never vested the Vice President or anyone else with unilateral authority to decide what electoral college votes to count and which not to count. I was clear on that throughout, I was clear with President Trump throughout all the way up to the morning of January 6th. But let's be clear on this point, it wasn't just that they asked for a pause, the president specifically asked me, and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me, to literally reject votes, which would have resulted in the issue being turned over to the House of Representatives and literally chaos would have ensued. So, Martha, people can read the indictment and frankly I said before I had hoped that it not come to this point, I don't know if the government can meet the standard, the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt for criminal charges, but the American people deserve to know their president Trump and his advisors didn't just ask me to pause, they asked me to reject votes, return votes, essentially to overturn the election. To keep faith with the oath that I made to the American people and the almighty God, I rejected that out of hand and I did my duty that day."

The same night, Steven Bannon went live with another episode of the War Room, applying even greater pressure to Pence while claiming "all hell is going to break loose tomorrow. Just understand this: All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. It’s going to be quick . . . It’s the fog of war.” Bannon also discussed putting Sen. Grassley’s number on the screen, and suggested they encourage users at TheDonald.win to contact the Senator.

Pence ultimately carried out his Constitutional duty as Vice President and certified the vote for Biden on January 6th.
## Pressuring Acting A.G. for False Election Claims
### Barr's Final Days
President Trump began making claims of voter fraud on the same night of the election before all of the ballots had even been counted. On November 9th, two days after Biden was declared the winner, Barr authorized widespread investigations by the DoJ and FBI into allegations of voter fraud. On November 23rd, Trump had a meeting with Barr, trying to figure out why the DoJ didn't have any strong cases yet for voter fraud, with Barr explaining that all of the accusations that had been made were without merit. On November 29th, Trump [falsely claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szStcNBIL68) on Fox News that the FBI and DoJ were "missing in action" and that he would "stay out of it" despite him interfering at multiple levels of federal and state government in investigations into voter fraud.

On December 1st, Barr invited an AP reporter for [an interview](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d) about the ongoing DoJ and FBI investigations, stating that they'd found absolutely nothing credible up to that point. Trump fought with Barr over the following two weeks, desperately attempting to get him to substantiate any kind of voter fraud. Repeating the same false claims to Barr that he had been over the last month, nothing was ever substantiate, with Barr eventually turning in his resignation on December 14th.

>And, in that context, I made clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff which I told the President was bullshit. And, you know, I didn’t want to be part of it. And that’s one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when I did.
>
>I observed, I think it was on December 1st, that—you know, I believe you can’t live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election—that there was fraud in the election.

### Clark Introduced to Donald Trump
On December 15th, Trump had a meeting with his new Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, Pat Cipollone, Mark Meadows, Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, and Acting General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Mizelle. This meeting was largely focused on a report on [Dominion machine](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000915111/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000915111.pdf) fraud by the Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), which Barr had had the DoJ investigate and found no evidence supporting. 

On December 22nd, Representative Scott Perry introduced Donald Trump to Jeffery Clark Acting Head of the Civil Division and Head of the Environmental and Natural Resources Division at the Department of Justice. On December 24th, Trump mentioned Clark's name to Rosen, which Rosen felt was strange because he had no idea why Trump would be communicating with Clark, and Clark communicating with Trump would be against DoJ policies.

On the 27th, President Trump had another phone call with Rosen and Donoghue in which he continued to make false claim after false claim, with Donoghue debunking each and every claim. The Georgia claims about Ruby, the Pennsylvania claims of the 205,000 supposed additional votes, the ASOG report, etc...etc...Eventually during this phone call, Rosen said to Trump that he needed to understand "understand that the DOJ can’t and won’t snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election. It doesn’t work that way."

Trump responded to Rosen, saying “I don’t expect you to do that, just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen.” Donoghue explained in his deposition that this was "an exact quote from the President."

>Q: Okay. So, in the middle of this call where he's ranting about election issues, he mentions the special counsel, he mentions the explosion in Tennessee, he mentions FBI -- allegations that the FBI doesn't like him, and he mentions Hunter Biden. All of that -- 
>
>A: Yes.
> 
>Q: -- just are part of the tangents that you referenced in terms of his manner of speaking? 
>
>A: Correct. 
>
>Q: And any response by you or Mr. Rosen to any of those specific -- 
>
>A: So, throughout this -- the President, obviously, does the great majority of the talking. But, throughout this, both DAG Rosen and I are just trying to respond very specifically to what he's saying and saying things like, "Okay, that's fine, sir." This thing about Pennsylvania having more votes than ballots actually cast, "We can look at that, we'll figure that out." You know, as far as some of this other stuff, we were saying, "We're aware of it. We've looked at it. We've got it," or, "There's nothing there." I can't remember if we were at the point -- I think we were at the point in Georgia to be able to say that we had looked at that and did not believe that to be the case. 
>
>Q: Yeah. That's the next section of your notes, where you say "Georgia legislature" -- or he talks about the Georgia legislature. Can you pick up from there? 
>
>A: Right. So it says, "Georgia legislature is on our side. They want to bring a case, but the Governor won't let them," meaning they want to file some sort of civil case. The Governor won't let them. He then goes back to the statistics. He says, "Statistically impossible for me to lose. Bookies had me at 100 percent on election night. It dropped to 32 percent in 4 or 5 hours. That's never happened before." So now this is an example of DAG Rosen responding. And he said essentially, "We'll look at whether we have more ballots in Pennsylvania than registered voters. Should be able to check that out quickly. But understand that the DOJ can't and won't snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election. It doesn't work that way." 
>
>Q: So DAG Rosen directly says, "We cannot snap our fingers and change the outcome of the election. It doesn't work that way." Clear pushback to the President looking for some sort of Department of Justice finger snap to delay the results of the election.
>
>A: Yes, that's what he said. And he was, to some extent, pushing back and -
>
>Q: - Yeah. 
>
>A: -- trying to make the President understand the Department's role.
>
>Q: Yeah. So what does the President say in response to that pushback from Mr. Rosen?
>
>A: He says, "I don't expect you to do that. Just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen."
> 
>Q: Tell me more about that. What you did you interpret that to mean?
>
>A: So I put it in quotes. It is an exact quote from the President. I took that to mean that he and his campaign, I suppose, were going to be pursuing a political effort on the Hill to challenge electoral college votes. And we knew that was the case already. There was already public reporting on this. So I think the President and some of his supporters were talking about challenging electoral college votes when they made it to the Senate. And so that didn't surprise me, that he had this avenue that he intended to pursue with what he called the "Republican Congressmen."

Trump brought up that people had told him that "Jeff Clark is great," and that he "should put him in," laying the groundwork for the events to come.
### Clark's Letter
On December 28th, 2020, Clark had Ken Klukowski, a senior counsel under Clark in the DoJ's Civil Division, draft [a letter](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014544_00012/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014544_00012.pdf) to the Georgia Governor and Legislature alleging the DoJ had "identified significant concerns
that may a have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia."  Everything in the letter, however, was a lie; the DoJ had zero reason to suspect any voter fraud at this point in time, and every investigation thus far has been a dead end.

Clark [emailed](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014544_00011/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014544_00011.pdf) Rosen and Donoghue, asking for a promotion so his title would look more authoritative on the letter, as well as requesting both of them to sign the letter.

>[!quote]- Jeffrey Clark, in [an email](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014544_00011/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014544_00011.pdf) to Rosen and Donoghue, December 28th, 2020
>
>Attached is a draft letter concerning the broader topic of election irregularities of any kind. The concept is to send it to the Governor, Speaker, and President pro temp of each relevant state to indicate that in light of time urgency and sworn evidence of election irregularities presented to courts and to legislative committees, the legislatures thereof should each assemble and make a decision about elector appointment in light of their deliberations. I set it up for signature by the three of us. I think we should get it out as soon as possible. Personally, I see no valid downsides to sending out the letter. I put it together quickly and would want to do a formal cite check before sending but I don't think we should let unnecessary moss grow on this 
>
>(As a small matter, I left open me signing as AAG Civil - after an order from Jeff as Acting AG designating me as actual AAG of Civil under the Ted Olson OLC opinion and thus freeing up the Acting AAG spot in ENRD for Jon Brightbill to assume. But that is a comparatively small matter. I wouldn't want to hold up the letter for that. But I continue to think there is no downside with as few as 23 days left in the President's term to give Jon and I that added boost in DOJ titles.)

Donoghue [responded](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014545_00007/pdf/GPO-J6-DOC-CTRL0000014545_00007.pdf), saying "there is no chance that I would sign this letter or anything remotely like this," with Rosen agreeing in a follow-up email.

Over the following days, Clark continues to speak with Trump, as well as Donoghue and Rosen, eventually making it clear that Trump wants appoint *him* to being the Acting Attorney General, replacing Rosen as Rosen was unwilling to cosign Trump's fraud while Clark was willing to play ball.
### The January 3rd Oval Office Meeting
With tensions building in the White House between Trump and his DoJ, events would finally culminate in a dramatic meeting in the Oval Office on January 3rd.

Rosen requested a meeting at 6:15 PM with Donald Trump thorugh Mark Meadows on the 3rd. Before the meeting, Rosen and Donoghue discussed the potential leadership change in the DoJ with Cipollone and Pat Philbin, who both opposed the change in leadership. Rosen and Donoghue had previously had a conference call where almost every Assistant Attorney General agreed they would resign if Rosen were removed from office and replaced with Clark.

Clark made an impassioned argument for why he should be made the new Attorney General, but every person present in the room confirmed to Trump that they would resign (along with hundreds of others in the DoJ) if Trump actually appointed him to the role.

Ultimately, Trump was too scared by the threat of mass resignations to push through with Clark's appointment, despite Clark's pleas otherwise.

## The January 6th Rally
### Motivation and Purpose of the Protest
Donald Trump hyped his supporters up for a large protest on January 6th, the day that the electoral vote would be certified, weeks before the actual event itself. The purpose of the protest was clearly aimed at protesting the certification of the election, with the goal of halting (or at least delaying) the certification. Trump continued to deny the results of the election and accused the media and political establishment of fighting against him. He tweeted for weeks to apply pressure as well to news networks and lawmakers to back his coup attempt in Congress.

Rupert Murdoch, January 20th, 2021.
The more I think about McConnell's remarks or complaint the more I agree.

Trump insisting on the election being stolen and convincing 251 of Americans was a huge
disservice to the country. Pretty much a crime. Inevitable it blew up Jan 6th

Best we don't mention his name unless essential and certainly don't support him.
We have to respect people of principle and if it comes to the Senate don't take sides.

I know he is being over demonized, but he brought it on himself.





Can you think of a SINGLE example over the past 40+ years where Trump has admitted he has legitimately lost anything? The Emmys: Rigged; Lost 2016 Iowa Caucus: Fraud; Lost 2016 Popular Vote: Voter Fraud (even before the election, which he won?!); E Jean Carroll Case: Fake accusation (even after losing the first trial, and I'm waiting for Round 3); NY Trial: (criminal) Rigged (bnd civil); Golf against Tiger Woods (former #1 golf player): He says he won (he cheated); Golf against Phil Mickelson (former #2 golf player): Says he won (how is a 70-some year old obese man beating professional golfers?); Trump Golf Club Champion (20 times by 2019 and was this years the most improved player...after winning consecutive senior championships) Trump Airline: Great Deal; Trump Steaks: Greatest, Trump University: Great, he will win the lawsuits, and students will comeback; Trump Magazine: Great;  Trump Wine: Largest Winery in the US (false); Bankruptcy: "Brilliant" (to get tax breaks). I honestly want to know what he is like playing Monopoly.
