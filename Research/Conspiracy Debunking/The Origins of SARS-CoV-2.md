# Purpose
The “[conspiracy theorists were correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/1h8c1nc/joe_rogan_all_the_conspiracy_theorists_were/)” idea remains pervasive in today's media environment. Even the most of the baseless theories that were propagated along the alternative (and mainstream) media networks over the past decade are propped up under this umbrella of uncertainty regarding conspiracy theories revolving around the origins of COVID and the associated medical topics around them. These have become so pervasive that both the left and right sides of the aisle have bought into them, with [over 50% of Americans believing that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, originated from a lab in China](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/45389-americans-believe-covid-origin-lab).

There is no conspiracy theory alive today where the scientific and empirical evidence stands so confidently and aggressively against the widespread (mis)conceptions regarding what is almost certainly true and what is baseless, unsupported speculation.

I will be dispelling much of the misinformation concerning the "lab leak" hypothesis (if you could even say there is one) and providing the strongest version of the zoonotic transfer argument in this document.

I'd also like to extend thanks for the many members in my community that pointed me in the right direction for research and information regarding this subject, and I'd like to thank the countless scientists and public health professionals who put in an unbelievable amount of tireless and thankless work on this subject as well.
# Zoonotic Spillover Hypothesis
When one accounts for all of the information available, one can say with a high degree of probability that SARS-CoV-2’s first appearance in humans was due to zoonotic spillover at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China. All of the available evidence points **heavily** in that direction, and the only "evidence" against it simply relies on a lack of knowledge about particular facts or education on the part of the listener with regards to how SARS-CoV-2, or any virus, works.
## Most Likely Zoonotic Spillover Explanation
There are an almost-universally agreed upon set of facts that, once removed from any political framing, make the origin of SARS-CoV-2's appearance in humans painfully obvious.
1. The first known infections occurred in the Seafood market, and the pattern of infections spread from there quite predictably in the weeks that followed.
	1. "[On 18 December, Ai Fen, director of the emergency department, encountered her first unexplained pneumonia patient, a 65-year-old man who had become ill on either 13 or 15 December. Unbeknownst to Ai at the time, the patient was a delivery-man at Huanan Market.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4454)" Although SARS-CoV-2 wasn't identified at the time, a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen collected from the patient was sent into analysis and identified on December 24th as a new SARSr-CoV strain.
	2. "[Dr. Zhang Jixian is considered the first doctor to report the novel coronavirus before its outbreak.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7262218/)" On December 26th, observed a senior couple who reported pneumonia-like symptoms and, due to her experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak, reported it to the Chinese CDC the next day. It's important to note that this elderly couple **had no known connection to the Huanan Seafood Market** at the time, dispelling the notion that people were simply applying a bias in trying to blame the market as the origin for SARS-CoV-2.
	3. Another patient, a worker at the HSM, was admitted on December 27th. On December 28th and 29th "[three more patients, all of whom worked at Huanan Market, were admitted and recognized to have the same unknown respiratory disease.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4454)" Similar patients, also linked to the HSM, were discovered at the Tongji and Xiehe hospitals, causing Xia Wenguang, the vice president of Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine to alert the CDC.
2. The Huanan Seafood Market is a likely location for such a spillover to occur as it contained the highest number of wild animal selling stalls in all of China. The animals that were kept in this stall were not only theorized to function as host species for these coronaviruses, a scientist had literally taken a trip to exactly this seafood market to the exact stall where these animals were held over 6 years prior and warned about the possibility of a spillover event.
	1. Edward Holmes, a biologist at the University of Sydney, visited China searching for likely places for a new outbreak to occur **back in 2014.** "[In a visit to Wuhan, a commercial center of 11 million people, scientists from the city’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention brought him to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. In stall after stall of the poorly ventilated space, he saw live wild animals — snakes, badgers, muskrats, birds — being sold for food. But it was the raccoon dogs that made him pull out his iPhone.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/health/wuhan-pandemic-edward-holmes.html)" These are the [same stalls](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715) that would later test with the highest amount of positive samples and with the highest density of positive samples epidemiologists would later collect.
3. Animal DNA later tested from the HSM found that animals there were actively shedding the virus.
	1. Researchers were able to sequence DNA from samples taken in stalls where very little human DNA was found and also discovered SARS-CoV-2 active in the samples from those stalls as well. "[Our analysis...provides genomic evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 susceptible live animals at the Huanan market, Wuhan, before it was closed on 1 January 2020. Importantly, the genomic data confirming the presence of wildlife species occurred in the same market stalls where some of these animals had been documented to be sold. These samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and often had a lower abundance of human genetic material than other animal genetic material, in some cases including animals known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2...Human genetic material was abundant and predominant in many samples with no evidence of non-human mammal DNA, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus at these sites was likely shed by humans.](https://zenodo.org/records/7754299)"
4. The animals brought to the Huanan Seafood Market were brought in from caves in South China, an area that is a rich reservoir for the types of coronaviruses the infect humans.
	1. Two genetic sequences for *sarbecovirus'*, the subgenus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to, have been identified in bats in South China, with similarities of "[96.8% for BANAL-52 and 96.1% for RaTG13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04532-4)." This is a closer ancestral match to a virus than what was even found for SARS-CoV-1, which also is believed to have emerged during a zoonotic spillover event.
## Challenges for Zoonotic Spillover
There are no issues, really, for the zoonotic spillover theory that require some extraordinary explanation. Everything is very neatly encapsulated in the official story, so much so that [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion_(2011_film)) have been made about pandemics originating in a similar manner (bonus, said movies even include scenes of people [pushing fake drugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9_PEu47ANE) to monetarily benefit from the panic they push!).

There are some "issues" that frauds push publicly, but most of these boil down to simple misunderstandings of science or misstatements of factually true things.
### The Wuhan Institute of Virology was very close to the Huanan Seafood Market
This is simply not true. A simple search of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Huanan Seafood Market shows that it's about a 12km drive between the two. For comparison, Manhattan Island at it's widest point is 3.7km and 21.6km long. The idea that someone could travel between the WIV and the HSM and infect only individuals at the HSM without infecting anyone else on the way there and on the way back is asinine.
### The Wuhan Institute of Virology Researchers were sick with COVID in November
This is not true. None of the researchers at the WIV have ever tested positive for COVID, despite claims that some were sick with COVID-like illnesses in the Fall of 2019. Past samples taken of all of these researchers have failed to confirm any SARS-CoV-2 positive infections, and there has never been any pattern of infections coming from any of the researchers. 
# Zoonotic Spillover Hypothesis
The challenges for the lab leak theory are numerous, but the largest challenge for the lab leak theory is that there isn’t even a single lab leak theory. There are many competing theories, some of which are necessarily mutually exclusive of one another, so even getting lab leak proponents to narrate a coherent theory from start to finish is incredibly challenging.
1. None of the researchers at the WIV were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
	1. Not even past samples had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for any of the researchers working there.
2. There are pictures of them going out and eating prior to the start of the pandemic, **after** they would have certainly been infected, if they had been infected secretly without anyone knowing.
# Background
## [SARS-CoV-2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9839213/)
### Naming
- SARS-CoV-2 stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
	- "Severe", meaning the virus' disease can be life-threatening.
	- "Acute", meaning the symptoms are sudden and worsen very quickly.
	- "Respiratory", meaning the virus replicates easiest in the respiratory system.
	- It is a part of the coronavirus (named due to the shape of the protruding, club-shaped spikes) group, which are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense (meaning they can be read by the host ribosomes), single-stranded RNA genome contained inside of a nucleocapsid. They range from 26-32 kilobases in size, one of the largest among RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2's gnome has about 29,903 nucleotide bases, or 29.9 kilobases.
- Taxonomy
	- Realm: Riboviria
		- Kingdom: Orthornavirae
			- Phylum: Pisuviricota
				- Class: Pisoniviricetes
					- Order: Nidovirales
						- Family: Coronaviridae
							- Genus: Betacoronavirus
								- Subgenus: Embecovirus
									- Contains HCoV-HKU1, HVoC-OC43
								- Subgenus: Sarbecovirus
									- Species: Betacoronavirus pandemicum
										- Contains SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, WIV1, RaTG13, BANAL-20-52
								- Subgenus: Merbecovirus
									- Contains: MERS-CoV
### Structure and Genome
- Structure
	- Spherical shaped virion, with a diameter of 80-120 nm, maintained by four structural proteins.
		- Spike Protein (S) (128-160 kDa)
			- It is surrounded by spike proteins, which are trimers, each composed of 3, long molecular chains of more than 1,273 amino acid residues.
			- Each of these trimers are composed of three monomers, which are then broken down into two subunits, S1 and S2.
				- The S1 subunits main role is to bind SARS-CoV-2 to a host cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE-2.
					- ACE-2 is found in cells in the intestines, kidneys, testis, gallbladder and heart.
				- The part of the S1 subunit that binds to ACE2 is called the RBD, or Region Binding Domain, or, more specifically, a part of the RBD, called the RBM, or Receptor Binding Motif
			- Determines tropism of the virus, or which cells it can infect via binding.
			- Infected cells with S proteins on the surface can also infect neighboring cells via cell-cell fusion.
		- Membrane Protein (M)
			- Supports the viral envelope, contains small inclusions of the envelope protein. Determines the shape and size of the viral capsid.
			- Interaction of M and S is necessary to retain S protein in the ERGIC and its inclusion in newly created virions.
			- Binding of M and N stabilizes nucleocapsid as well as inner core of the virion and contributes to completion of virus assembly.
		- Envelope Protein (E) (8-12 kDa)
			- Small, integral protein anchored into the membrane. Modulates the process of virion release.
		- Nucleocapsid Protein (N)
			- Helically symmetrical nucleocapsid which is formed by a single-stranded genomic RNA coated by nucleocapsid protein.
			- Localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, and involved in the assembly and budding of viral particles.
- Genome
	- 26-32 kilobases in length.
		- 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16).
		- 4 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E, as described above).
		- 11 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c, and ORF10).
### Lifecycle
1. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into a host cell primarily by binding the RBD of the S1 subunit of the Spike protein to ACE2. Once receptor engagement has occurred, if the Spike protein has been previously cleaved by furin during viral synthesis, the S2' site will be exposed, allowing cleavage by TMPRSS2 at the cell surface.
	1. If the S1-S2 FCS has not already been cleaved during viral synthesis, it will have to wait for furin to cleave it before cleavage at S2' can happen.
	2. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can gain entrance into the cell by being absorbed into the endosomal compartment following ACE2-mediated endocytosis, where it is then cleaved by cathepsin L.
2. The conformational changes in the S2 subunit following S1 subunit dissociation allows for the insertion of the FP (fusion peptide) into the membrane of the cell, driving viral fusion.
3. Gemonic RNA, once inside the cell, is immediately recognized and translated by the cell's ribosome, creating polyproteins which then process non-structural proteins.
4. Formation of the double-membrane vesicles occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, creating a space in the cell for viral processing to begin.
5. Genomic sense RNA is converted into antisense form of genomic and subgenomic RNAs.
6. Antisense form is then converted back into the sense form of genomic and subgenomic RNAs.
7. Subgenomic mRNAs are translated in the ER into structural and accessory proteins.
8. Genomic RNA interacts with N protein, forming a nucleocapsid.
9. Nucleocapsid combines with structural proteins to form a virion.
10. The mature virion released from the cell by exocytosis.

## The Pandemic
### Origin
1. The first known cases of COVID-19 were detected in the city of Wuhan, a population 12,000,000 people metropolis in the Chinese province of Hubei.
2. On December 26th-27th, 2019, [[Dr. Zhang Jixian]] examined two patients (at the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine) with unusual CT scans and suspected them of having a SARS-like disease.
3. On December 30th, Wuhan hospitals posted an emergency notice concerning 27 patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, with at least some of these early cases appearing to be connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
4. On January 1st, HSM was sanitized (partly due to heavy interference from the Chinese government), with samples being collected afterwards.
5. On January 20th, 2020, the Chinese National Health Commission publicly confirmed COVID-19's spread to healthcare workers, and on the 23rd Wuhan entered lockdown.
6. From December 10th, 2019, to January 1st, 2020, approximately 200 people are known to have had onset of COVID, of which 62 or 63 were vendors at the market and others had known epidemiological connections to it.
#### First Cases
- The WHO identified 174 known cases in December of 2019, with 30 being vendors and 25 being visitors to the Huanan Seafood Market.
### Huanan Seafood Market
1. 1,200 employee market with 680 shops, located on the first story of a multistory building.
2. The market sold wild and exotic live animals, with some being imported from south China, where wild coronaviruses are prevalent.
	1. The market did not sell bats, the suspected species that would have been the carrier for the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, though animals sold from the market were imported from south China, where bats that almost certainly carried the progenitor are found.
#### Testing at the Market
1. HSM was closed on January 1st, with 515 environmental samples being collected that day, with 364 additional environmental samples being collected from January 12th to March 2nd. 457 more samples from animals were collected from January 18th to March 30th, but it is important to note that none of these animals were the animals originally present for the theoretically spillover event.
2. None of the 457 animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were taken from dead animals in cold storage, and only 16 came from animals that were even plausible SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with most samples being collected 2 months after HSM was closed.
3. The environmental samples tested from the market were clustered around a very specific location, pointing towards a particular zoonotic spillover site. That specific location was known to have had live animals and employees known to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
4. The two stores with the most positive samples were stores with wild animals. One in particular, stall 6:29, had live raccoon dogs, one of the species suspected to be the intermediary for SARS-CoV-2, and was specifically identified in 2014 as a potential location of a novel disease spillover by Dr. Edward Holmes.
5. 60 drains were sampled January 27th-29th, with four testing positive, including the drain in front of shop 6:29. Two weeks later the drains were tested, of the 17 drains sampled from February 9th-15th, only three were positive, again the one in front of shop 6:29 tested positive, and two downstream from it.
### Uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2
1. BANAL-20-52 is a sarbecovirus sampled in Laos from a bat dropping with 96.8% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2, closer than any ancestor we found for SARS-CoV-1.
	1. BANAL-20-52 is missing the FCS that SARS-CoV-2 has. Bat's typically transmit virus' from their fecal droppings, meaning an FCS would likely be harmful to the lifecycle of this virus if present in a bat.
2. Furin Cleavage Site
	1. Furin recognizes proteins with an amino acid sequence of RxxR, and especially RRxR.
	2. The CGGCGG sequence is not quite as odd as people think. There's no reason to really expect that the sequence could have evolved over time through chance verse being inserted naturally through other evolutionary means. The out-of-frame insertion also seems to cut against the idea that this was done in a laboratory.
3. ACE2 binding affinity
	1. SARS-CoV-2 does seem to bind best to human ACE2 receptors out of the 14 species studied.
	2. The second highest affinity studied, however, was for pangolin, which is similar to human ACE2.
## Project DEFUSE
### Origin
1. In 2018, EcoHealth Alliance submitted a grant request to DARPA for $14m for "Project DEFUSE."
	1. 3.5 year project on studying bat coronaviruses in collaboration with 5 other groups (University of North Carolina, Duke-National University Singapore, Wuhan Institute of Virology, USGS National Wildlife Health Center, and Palo Alto Research Group).
	2. This projected was ultimately not funded.
### Goals
1. Collect bat coronaviruses and perform computer and lab testing on them.
2. Add vaccines and immune boosting agents to wild bats.
3. Create an app for soldiers to determine likelihood of bats having dangerous diseases.

It's noteworthy that no genetic engineering was to be performed at WIV, nor would any chimeric viruses be transported there, except for prototype vaccines which use a raccoonpox chimera. WIV was to be involved with samples collected from bats, tests on bats, tests on people who live near bats, and experiments in bat caves.

Project DEFUSE was involved in studying a broad array of things related to coronaviruses and did not really lay out a precise blueprint for creating SARS-CoV-2. especially not in any singular research lab.
# The Case for Zoonotic Origin
## Challenging Questions for Lab Leakers
1. What is the explanation for a and b lineages both showing up for the very first time in the wet market?
	1. If it came from a lab, why two different variants?
2. There has never been a gain of function lab leak before, this would have to be the first one.
3. How do you explain the novel backbone used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
	1. It seems like the lab leak theory relies on a completely unpublished virus using some novel and unpredicted things, e.g. the FCS location and the particular RBD amino acids.
4. Why did the virus spread at the wet market first, when other origin sites would have made more sense?
5. The FCS add was added out of frame, using a leading residue that isn't typically used in experiments (SARS-CoV-2 has Proline or Alanine before the RxxR site).
6. Why are all of the earliest cases connected to the market? Why weren't early clusters surrounding the lab? Or in a mall or some other more densely populated place?
	1. FIND EXACT FIGURES
7. How do you explain easy, early mutations that appear in a single *in vivo* generation like D614G?
8. Why were Shi Zhengli and other scientists going out to eat in December and traveling if they thought they were infected by a lab-leaked virus?
9. Why did they even publish RaTG13, the closets coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2? Why is it only 96% similar?
	1. This was published after SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced.
10. Why haven't there been more SARS-CoV-2 leaks since so many new labs are working on it now, with even more infectious strains?
11. Why did the sampling in the HSM bias where the raccoon dogs were found?
12. Why did no retroactive samples show SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring prior to the earliest cases detected at the HSM?
	1. ZO debate 1, slide 116 - Wuhan, Baidu data shows very little signal for symptoms of a circulating coronavirus prior to December
	2. ZO debate 1, slide 114 - Wuhan, 3850 blood bank samples from Sep-Dec 2019 show no positives for antibodies
	3. ZO debate 1, slide 113 - Wuhan, 640 throat swabs Oct 6th - Jan 21st 2020. No positives in 2019, 9 in 2020.
	4. ZO debate 1, slide 112 - WHO report data with hundreds of influenza like illness samples and no positives in 2019 from Hubei and Wuhan.
	5. ZO debate 1, slide 110/111 - Wuhan excess mortality in early 202, no Hubei excess mortality signal until 2020 (and it’s very small)
	6. ZO debate 1, slide 109 - Wuhan, no uptick in hospitalizations until December 2019.
	7. ZO debate 1, slide 106 - WHO report, followed up on 92 ILI cases later, could find only 67, none with antibodies.
## For Lab-Leak to be True
1. Project DEFUSE research was started, even though the grant was declined.
2. The research exclusively happened in WIV, despite project DEFUSE being a collaborative effort of multiple research groups involved, with many important components happening at the University of North Carolina.
3. The research discovered (and leaked) SARS-CoV-2 very quickly, as project DEFUSE research was planned to take 3.5 years to complete.
4. A secret viral backbone needs to have been discovered (found and sampled from a wild animal) and experimented with.
5. Project DEFUSE specifies using viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-1 (80% similarity to SARS-CoV-2).
6. Optimal RBD amino acids not predicted by computer models would have had to have been discovered via the creation of this novel virus, without running into other obvious mutations (D614G, and N501Y)
7. No one at the lab ever tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the initial outbreak according to the 2021 WHO report, and there were no turnover of staff in the coronavirus team.
	1. The reserved sera in April 2019 and March 2020 from all the workers and students in research group led by Professor Shi Zhengli were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
## False Assertions by Lab Leakers
1. The distance from the lab is not 1 mile, it's more like 12 miles.
2. SARS' spill-over animal was not found. Most exact spill-overs were not found.
