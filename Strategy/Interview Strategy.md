# Protests
## Students and “Children” (under 25)
The goal is to interview people as easily as possible in order to gather as wide a variety of opinions and conversations as possible. In order to accomplish this, that means I likely need to:
- be as non-confrontational as possible
- try to avoid “debating” or “critically drilling” to the point of discomfort
- review the conversations I do record in the most positive and constructive manner possible
	- this includes not allowing my stream/community to dogpile interviewees.
Exceptions for any of these rules can probably be made for people that are:
- exceptionally aggressive (entire negative encounter NEEDS to be caught on camera in order to justify any negative or critical comments about the person)
- people who opt for a more aggressive/critical conversation (doesn’t necessarily mean we are attacking them hardcore, but we can be a bit more critical of their talking points)
- people who are public figures or “leaders” at their given protests
