Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result. “When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors.

- PDF page 41, THESE STATEMENTS WERE ALWAYS JUST OPINIONS
- Reasonable people understand that the “language of the political arena, like the language used in labor disputes … is often vituperative, abusive and inexact.” Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 708 (1969). It is likewise a “well recognized principle that political statements are inherently prone to exaggeration and hyperbole.” Planned Parenthood of Columbia/Willamette, Inc. v. Am. Coal. of Life Activists, 244 F.3d 1007, 1009 (9th Cir. 2001). Given the highly charged and political context of the statements, it is clear that Powell was describing the facts on which she based the lawsuits she filed in support of President Trump. Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves characterize the statements at issue as “wild accusations” and “outlandish claims.” Id. at ¶¶ 2, 60, 97, 111. They are repeatedly labelled “inherently improbable” and even “impossible.” Id. at ¶¶ 110, 111, 114, 116 and 185. Such characterizations of the allegedly defamatory statements further support Defendants’ position that reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact but view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process. 
- Powell admits in her defense that the statements were wild and that no one should believe them, despite Trump saying people went to J6 because of election fraud concerns.

# Pence's story
View of Pence: Weak, disloyal, gives in
Counter-presentation: Loyal, incredibly strong, brave
Things to keep in mind:
- Prefer direct testimony from Pence, then people around him, then indirect testimony/reporting.
- Highlight Pence's individual decisions.

## General Overview
On November 3rd, Mike Pence contradicted a statement Donald Trump made after trying to claim victory in the election.

Public pressure started to ramp up against Pence in the weeks leading up to the election.

Donald Trump had personal conversations with Pence, as did Trump's aids with Pence and Pence's aids.

Pence refused Donald Trump at every turn, after consulting with his legal advisors. He made public his intentions the entire time.

- J6 Report
	- "As you read this report, please consider this: Vice President Pence, along with many of the appointed officials who surrounded Donald Trump, worked to defeat many of the worst parts of Trump’s plan to overturn the election. This was not a certainty. It is comforting to assume that the institutions of our Republic will always withstand those who try to defeat our Constitution from within. But our institutions are only strong when those who hold office are faithful to our Constitution. We do not know what would have happened if the leadership of the Department of Justice declared, as Donald Trump requested, that the election was “corrupt,” if Jeff Clark’s letters to State Legislatures had been sent, if Pat Cipollone, Jeff Rosen, Richard Donoghue, Steve Engel and others were not serving as guardrails on Donald Trump’s abuses.""

		- No White House Counsel attending
	- "President Trump and outside attorney John Eastman attempt to convince Vice President Pence to set aside the Electoral College votes of seven states when he presides over the January 6 Joint Session of Congress."
	- So the Vice President mostly asked a series of questions in that meeting of Mr. Eastman. And from my -- and, again, I mentioned this before -- from my very first conversation with the Vice President on the subject, his immediate instinct was that there  is no way that one person could be entrusted by the Framers to exercise that authority. And never once did I see him budge from that view, and the legal advice that I provided him merely reinforced it
