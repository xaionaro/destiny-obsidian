## The Argument
From the plaintiffs - 
- The Government has created a law that is forcing a US Entity (TikTok), whom enjoys First Amendment protections (Invokes strict scrutiny review), to potentially cease operations (where freedom of speech is implicated), based on the actions of a third party (ByteDance) who's implicated by said law only due to the Government disliking the content (Speech) of the US Entity involved.

1. TikTok's speech is implicated, their speech being access to/control of the algorithm, and their speech is shut down if they lose access to this
2. The Law passed by the government is implicating Content/freedom of speech
3. TikTok's survival depends on a foreign party's response to said law (ByteDance/China's response to the law/lawsuit).
 or
1. The law imposes a direct regulation on a third party
2. This regulation shuts down someone else's speech
3. The law is passed for viewpoint(speech) based reasons

## Feelings
If this law is supposed to protect US data so much, why are there carveouts for other types of companies, and why does the language seem to target TikTok with surgical precision, e.g. only companies that are both foreign-controlled-adversaries AND social media companies.

BUT

None of this matters, it probably stands as a matter of law. Most the Justices seem unconvinced by the plaintiffs.
