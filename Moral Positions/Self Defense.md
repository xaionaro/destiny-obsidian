- If someone attacks you, knowing you have a lethal weapon on you, it's safe to infer lethal intent from the aggressing party.
- If you are carrying a lethal weapon, you have a moral obligation (and in some states, it can be a mitigating factor for considering self defense) to extricate yourself from situations and to avoid potentially escalatory situations unless there are other factors involved posing significant harm to another person.
- There needs to some sort of proportionality/assessment of a risk when considering how to respond.
