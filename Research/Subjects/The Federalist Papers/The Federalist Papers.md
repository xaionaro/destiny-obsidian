# The Federalist Papers
- [Full Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text) for all of the Federalist Papers
## Federalist No. 1 - General Introduction
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493264)
### Notes
- The opening Federalist Paper is essentially Hamilton introducing himself as someone who is openly supporting the Constitution. He warns people that many arguments will be made both in favor and against a stronger Union, and to warn against people assuming bad intentions by either side, but also to be careful as "good things" be hide bad intentions.
## Federalist No. 2 - Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence
- Author: [[John Jay]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Jay argues that the nation springs from a common background of people who have shared a common struggle, and only survived up to this point because of how important a union of all the states was seen as. He continues to argue that the States will only survive with a strong federal government moving forward.
## Federalist No. 3 - The Same Subject Continued: Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence
- Author: [[John Jay]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Jay argues that having a national, unified government produces better environments for its people, with the first argument concerning PEACE. He argues that one national government has more capability and uniformity in accepting and enforcing treaties than multiple governments would, therefor maintaining greater periods of peace for the citizens. States would also serve to balance each other's interests in a national government. A unified government can cool and temper the individual interests of the state, and also represent a stronger bargaining piece against foreign friend and foe alike. This paper is arguing in protecting the nation from JUST causes of war.
## Federalist No. 4 - The Same Subject Continued: Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence
- Author: [[John Jay]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- This essay argues against protecting the nation from UNJUST (PRETEND) causes of war. Other countries would probably grow unhappy with the growth of America's shipping and fishing industry, as a given example, and a unified federal government would discourage parties from engaging in warfare against the US springing from these jealousies. Jay argues that a divided government among several confederacies would be ineffective at responding to foreign threats, as divided States would be too tempted to maintain their neutrality and too unwilling to shed bled in defense of another party. A United States, argued Jay, would be far more tempting to befriend than to make war with, a divided States would be easier to pick apart and conquer.
## Federalist No. 5 - The Same Subject Continued: Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence
- Author: [[John Jay]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Jay argues in this essay that the growing strength in some HIVES would cause them to invade and steal resources from the others, should America be three or four separate governments instead of one unified government. Competition between local confederacies would invite competing alliances with foreign nations who would then be able to exert more influence over the American confederacies.
## Federalist No. 6 - Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Hamilton begins by laying out all the different ways that neighboring nations have come to compete and fight with each other in the past. He argues against the idea that commerce alone would dissuade nations from warring each other, as they continue to do so up to that day.
### Quotes
- "Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics; two of them, Athens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were they as often engaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the neighboring monarchies of the same times. Sparta was little better than a well regulated camp; and Rome was never sated of carnage and conquest."
## Federalist No. 7 - The Same Subject Continued: Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Hamilton argues in this essay that dolling out land that was apportioned under the current Union in the absence of another Union would be impossible, and would lead to conflict. He also argues that the debt assumed by the Union would impossible to fairly apportion, and it would lead to a great deal of conflict. All of the reasons Europe has been embroiled in war over the prior centuries would emerge in America if the United States were to break apart into multiple confederacies.
## Federalist No. 8 - The Consequences of Hostilities Between the States
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- This essay argues for how catastrophic a war would be in the newly formed American confederates were they to break apart. If states were constantly warring with one another, and had larger armies, then freedoms of its citizens would necessarily be curtailed, and the soldiery and militaries would be seen as superior to the ordinary citizens, and the states would be dedicating a large amount of their resources and leadership to simply maintaining their militaries.
### Quotes
- "Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free."
## Federalist No. 9 - The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Hamilton quotes at length from Montesquieu and argues about the strength of confederacies, and differentiates between confederacies of states vs dissolving states into a single unified government. He also critiques Montesquieu, demonstrating that, even though he was a good source of intellectual political philosophical thought, he was not perfect, so the framers of the new Constitution had the ability to improve upon some of his ideas.
## Federalist No. 10 - The Same Subject Continued: The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection
- Author: [[James Madison]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-1-10#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493265)
### Notes
- Madison argues in favor of a structured Republic that can protect rights more effectively than a pure Democracy and explores means by which a government can fight against the tyranny of a corrupt majority or a sinister minority.
## Federalist No. 11 - The Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-11-20)
### Notes
- Hamilton argues in this essay that having a strong union produces the best outcomes insofar as having strong trade, global navigation, and leverage to maintain peace or neutrality with other nations. Nations would be more easily able to divide us against each other or play sides with us if we were separate countries, and we are able to take advantage of their divisions more easily if we are united.
### Quotes
- "But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or remorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral."
## Federalist No. 12 - The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-11-20)
### Notes
- Hamilton is arguing in this essay for the massive benefits that trade endows on every part of the country (and world) that participates in it. There's arguments that taxation needs to be done effectively with regards to commerce and agriculture, so one side isn't disfavored. Hamilton also argues that contraband and illegal trade would necessarily occur and thrive and would require immensely powerful patrols (as in France) to stop.
### Quotes
- "The assiduous merchant, the laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the industrious manufacturer,--all orders of men, look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils. The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has, from indubitable experience, received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them, and has proved, to the satisfaction of their friends, that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven. It has been found in various countries that, in proportion as commerce has flourished, land has risen in value. And how could it have happened otherwise?"
## Federalist No. 13 - Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-11-20)
### Notes
- This essay is arguing that one massive government costs just a bit more than multiple smaller governments, meaning it is more efficient and less tax-burdensome to have a single federal government as opposed to multiple, smaller confederacies.
## Federalist No. 14 - Objections to the Proposed Constitution From Extent of Territory Answered 
- Author: [[James Madison]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-11-20)
### Notes
- Madison argues that America can successfully be the largest Republic to have ever been tried. Madison points out that over the prior 13 years, representatives from each state government have indeed been successfully meeting in Congress. He argues that there are large countries in Europe that already have members that travel far to meet in their parliamentary bodies, and it would be trivially easy to do it in the US as well. The 13 colonies have created something grand and great after the Revolution, and it would be horrible to mankind to see it fail or dissolve into tribes or councils.
### Quotes
- "A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently stand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and resources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our western or northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the seat of government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone against an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual danger. If they should derive less benefit, therefore, from the Union in some respects than the less distant States, they will derive greater benefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout."
## Federalist No. 15 - The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union 
- Author: [[Alexander Hamilton]]
- [Text](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-11-20)
### Notes
- In this essay, Hamilton is arguing that the current federal government has obvious defects that are apparent to all. The current confederacy has made promises (debt etc...) to its own citizens and foreign agents that it is unable to pay back. Hamilton goes through a long list of ills befalling the current confederacy, including its inability to form treaties, pay back its debts, borrow money, or take advantage in commerce of the extensive natural resources available to it. He argues that States cannot maintain all of their power and independence and solve the problems that the confederacy is currently facing.
- Hamilton argues that if we simply rely upon treaties, they will be formed and broken quickly depending upon the conveniences or passions of each confderacy. Hamilton also argues that a weaker federal government will mean that individual confederacies would evaluate every federal dictate based on how beneficial it would be to follow it at a precise moment in time, and would lead to disharmony as individual governments would only follow what is convenient for them.
### Quotes
- "There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time, place, circumstance, and quantity; leaving nothing to future discretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of this kind exist among all civilized nations, subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war, of observance and non-observance, as the interests or passions of the contracting powers dictate. In the early part of the present century there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this species of compacts, from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realized. With a view to establishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world, all the resources of negotiation were exhausted, and triple and quadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed before they were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to mankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith, and which oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any immediate interest or passion."
- " It at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to reputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one. A spirit of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses, for which they would blush in a private capacity."
- "If, therefore, the measures of the Confederacy cannot be executed without the intervention of the particular administrations, there will be little prospect of their being executed at all. The rulers of the respective members, whether they have a constitutional right to do it or not, will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves. They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this will be done; and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny, without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state, which is essential to a right judgment, and with that strong predilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to mislead the decision. The same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is constituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies; who have seen how difficult it often is, where there is no exterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from each other, at different times, and under different impressions, long to co-operate in the same views and pursuits."
