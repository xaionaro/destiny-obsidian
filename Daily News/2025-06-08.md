	- Started on June 6th
	- 100+ protestors were arrested, according to the U.S. attorney's office
	- On June 7th, Trump signed [a memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/department-of-defense-security-for-the-protection-of-department-of-homeland-security-functions/) around 6 PM PST ordering 2,000 National Gaurd members to LA to protect federal officers conducting immigration operations, with the objection of Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass
		- The president invoked [10 U.S.C. 12406](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406) for this
- [Newsome Tweet](https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1931540820517360125) on June 7th, claiming that Trump is calling in the National Guard purely for spectacle
- [Another Newsome Tweet](https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1931723070684995621) on the 8th, stating that Trump was taking credit for quelling the violence before the National Guard was even present on the ground.
- [Newsom Tweet](https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1931699991082647959) on June 8th about Kristi Noem backing Abbot to retain control of his national guard against potential abuse by Biden. Obviously they have completely flipped now for Trump in California.
- [Another Newsom Tweet](https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1931823848879726674) about Trump's abuse of power, with all Democratic governors agreeing
