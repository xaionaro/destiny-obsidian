# Location
- [[Iran]]
# Causes
- Under the Qajar Dynasty (1789-1925), the Shahs of Iran made deals with European powers that gave them access to local markets that severely undercut local ability to produce goods.
	- From 1891-1892, the Tobacco protest occurred as a result of [[Naser al-Din Shah]] agreeing to a deal with an Englishman, Baron [[Paul Julius Reuter]] for a 50-year monopoly over the distribution and exportation of tobacco in exchange for personal enrichment. This lead to nationwide protests erupting amongst the bazaari, the ulama and the dissident intellectuals.
	- [[Mirza Hasan Shirazi]], the most important religious authority in Iran, issued a fatwa against the use of tobacco that was so effective, it ended up reversing the deal made by the Shah and showed Iranians for the first time that it was possible to protest successfully over the Shah and foreign interests.
- During the early 1800's, European (Russian) militaries also possessed superior technology and capabilities which allowed them to seize lands and money from Qajar Iran.
- 1905 saw protests against tariffs that were financing [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]] and his extravagant tour of Europe.
- The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 saw the first Asian victory over a European power, notably the only Asian power with a constitution (Japan) defeating the only European power without one (Russia).
- Different groups sharing a common enemy came together to form the constitutionalist movement
	- The Ulama, or Islamic scholars
	- Liberal and radical intellectuals, who witnessed expanding Western development during their travels
	- Bazaari, or merchants who wanted strong institutions to support more stable market places
- [[Naser al-Din Shah]] was assassinated on May 1st, 1896.
- [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]] ascended to the throne next, though his leadership was weak and his financial troubles and extravagant lifestyle lead him to borrow a lot of money from Russia and Britain.
	- He would sign the 1906 constitution shortly before his death.
# Facts
## First Protests
- In 1905, people began protesting tariffs that were placed to repay Russian loans made to [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]].
- In December of 1905, two merchants in Tehran were bastinadoed for price-gouging, eventually leading to protests that were dispersed by the government.
- On January 12th, 1906, the Shah agreed to dismiss his prime minister and create a "house of justice."
## The Constitution
- A constitution modeled after the Belgian constitution was signed by [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]] on December 31st, 1906.
- The constitution defined rules for elections to the Majilis.
	- The Majilis was a bicameral legislature, who's two bodies were referred to as the National Consultative Assembly and the Senate.
	- The Constitutional Amendment of 1907 declared Twelver Shi'ism to be the state religion, and called for a council of five Twelver clerics to ensure passed laws comply with Islam.
## Mohammad Ali Shah
- [[Mohammad Ali Shah]] came to power in January 1907.
- He opposed the constitutionalists.
- The [[Anglo-Russian Convention]] was signed, dividing Iran into a Russian zone in the north and a British zone in the south, with a neutral area in the center.
## The Minor Tyranny/civil war of 1908-1909
- In 1908, [[Mohammad Ali Shah]] staged a coup d'état to eliminate the majilis. After fighting in Tabriz (which had been occupied by Russia), the Shah's soldiers were repelled by [[Sattar Khan]], the commander in chief fo the constitutionalist forces.
## The End
- In December of 1911, everything fell apart and the Second Majilis ended.
# Outcome
- The Constitutional Revolution occurred but fell apart, so no lasting governmental changes occurred as a result of this.
# Important Notes
- This was the first time in Iran's history that demonstrated the people's ability to collectively protest against the Shah and foreign influence and come out on top.
- There were clear divisions amongst religious scholars here concerning whether or not a democracy could form in a way that was compliant with Shiah Islam.
