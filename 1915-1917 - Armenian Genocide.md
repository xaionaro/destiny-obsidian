## Background
- Aremenians had existed in [[Anatolia]] since ~ 500 BCE, about 1,500 years before the arrival of Turkmens of the [[Seljuk dynasty]].
- The Kingdom of Armenia was a Christian nation.
- After the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1453, two Islamic empires, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Safavid Empire]], contested Western Armenia.
- On the Eve of WWI, in 1914, there were around 2 million Armenians living in Ottoman territory, mostly in Anatolia.
### Ottoman Empire Reforms
- Ottoman reforms beginning in 1839 attempted to equalize the status of Ottoman subjects, regardless of religion, though opposition by Islamic clergy and Muslims in general made this mostly theoretical.
- In 1876, Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] came to power in the Ottoman Empire and began to sedentarize the Kurds, forcing them to settle in Armenian towns, leading to the mass usurpation of Armenian land. This would last all the way until World War I.xt
