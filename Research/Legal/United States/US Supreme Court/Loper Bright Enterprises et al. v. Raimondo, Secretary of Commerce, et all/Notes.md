# Notes
- Majority written by Chief Justice John Roberts
	- Reference to the 1984 Chevron case, citing the two-step rule process
		- First, after a challenge to a particular issue of executive agency enforcement, the court must see if Congress has explicitly spoken about the issue at hand.
		- Secondly, the court must then determine, if the answer is no in the first part, if the executive agency's interpretation of Congress's order is permissible based on the legislated statutes.
	- Roberts claims that the court should be in charge of reading explicitly how a statute is intended by constructing that contention solely on their own, without any deference to executive implementation or interpretation.
	- "In the business of statutory interpretation, if it is not the best, it is not permissible."
	- Roberts thinks that the court is always correct in their statutory interpretation and thus is more equipped to make determinations than the executive branch is.
	- Chevron step-zero is referenced - a federal court determines whether or not Congress intended for agencies or courts to possess interpretive authority over a statue.
	- Maintains that the APA demands that the Courts continue to decide matters of law in regards to statutory construction.
- Concurring opinion of Justice Clarence Thomas
	- Thomas argues that *Chevron* compelled judges to abdicate their Article III judicial responsibility and expanded the executive power of agencies beyond their constitutional limits.
- Concurring opinion of Justice Neil Gorsuch
