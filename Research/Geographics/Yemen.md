## 1962-1970 - The North Yemen Civil War
- Background
	- Yemen
		- In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against Imam Ahmad bin Yahya.
		- Ahmad bin Yahya defeated the besiegers, publicly decapitating Ahmad Thalaya and then executing Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48 year old Foreign Minister who was to become the new leader under Thalaya's demands.
		- In March of 1958, Ahmad bin Yahya's son, Muhammad al-Badr, went to Damascus to tell Nasser that Yemen would adhere to the United Arab Republic, as long as Ahmad could keep his throne and power.
		- In 1959, while Ahmad went to Rome for medical treatments, fights between tribal chieftains erupted. When Ahmad returned, he decapitated one of his subjects and amputated the left hand and right foot of 15 others.
		- Imam Ahmad died on September 18th, 1962, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad al-Badr, who appointed Colonel Abdullah Sallal, a known socialist and Nasserist, as commander of the palace guard.
	- Egypt
		- Nasser had desired regime change in Yemen since 1957, and acted in January of 1962 by supporting the Free Yemen Movement.
		- In a desire to continue his pursuit of Arab nationalism, especially after the dissolution of the UAR in 1961, Nasser supported a regime change in Yemen by supporting Colonel Abdullah Sallal.
		- Nasser's considerations for sending troops to Yemen may have included the following
			- impact of his support to the [Algerian War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War_of_Independence "Algerian War of Independence") from 1954–62
			- Syria breaking up from Nasser's UAR in 1961
			- taking advantage of a breach in British and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the [FLN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria) "National Liberation Front (Algeria)") in [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria") and primarily for his efforts to undermine the [Central Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Treaty_Organization "Central Treaty Organization") (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the [Iraqi monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kings_of_Iraq "List of Kings of Iraq") in 1958
			- confronting [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny
			- guaranteeing dominance of the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea") from the [Suez Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal") to the [Bab-el-Mandeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb "Bab-el-Mandeb") strait
			- retribution against the [Saudi royal family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_royal_family "Saudi royal family"), whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.

			- The US, under John F. Kennedy, tried to resolve the dispute while communicating with Nasser (Egypt), Faisal (Saudi Arabia), Hussein (Jordan) and Salla (Yemen). Nasser agreed to pull out, only if Jordan and Saudi Arabia also stopped their aggression, but Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not trust Egyptian intentions for the peninsula.
			- Sallal proclaimed he would follow Yemen's international obligations, including respect for Britain's Aden Protectorate, and Nasser promised a gradual withdrawal of its 18,000 man force, as long as Saudi Arabian and Jordanian forces retire from border regions.
			- On December 19th, 1962, the US recognized the Yemen Arab Republic, with the UN following the next day.

			- On September 4th, 1964, the UN admitted failure and ended the mission.
	- Egyptian offenses

		- On May Day of 1966, Nasser said the war was entering the "long-breath strategy," where he would draw down troops from 70k to 40k and simply focus on reinforcing tighter positions, withdrawing from exposed positions. He also insisted on attacks on Najran, Qizan and other "bases of aggression", claiming they were originally Yemeni towns stolen by the Saudis in the 1930's.

	- Siege of Sana'a
