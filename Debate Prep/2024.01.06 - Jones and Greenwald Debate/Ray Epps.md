- Questions
	- If Ray Epps was a known FBI informant, why did they mess up and publish him on their FBI Washington Field Twitter account and their most wanted list?
	- Did Ray Epps actually make any commands on the day of January 6th?
	- If Baked Alaska was so intelligent in being able to point out that Ray Epps was a "glowie" issuing illegal commands to people, why the fuck did he actually then proceed to enter the Capitol building the next day???
	- Why didn't the FBI scrub Epps' presence before choosing him for this essential mission?
	- Why did Epps himself confess to his local newspaper about being at the J6 protests?
	- Why did the FBI so blatantly remove Suspect 16 and not replace him with another photo, change the numbering of everyone on the site, or just leave him up so as to not draw obvious suspicion?
	- Why wouldn't the FBI just block webcrawlers like the wayback machine like so many other sites have???
	- Why wouldn't the FBI have just arrested Epps immediately to hide suspicion?
	- Why wouldn't they take down all the videos posted online about him if they controlled platforms like Twitter?
	- Why is Ray Epps intelligent enough to infiltrate the January 6th protests, instigate riots, and coordinate the first breach of the Capitol grounds, but stupid enough to text his nephew claiming he orchestrated it?



COUNTER NARRATIVE
- Boomer guy who believed that Trump genuinely thought the election was stolen, so he showed up to protest in the Capitol, but wanted things to remain peaceful.
- Probably didn't have any active major connections, and probably wasn't involved in any violent coordination.
