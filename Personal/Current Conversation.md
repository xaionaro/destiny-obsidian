1. 4 Pillars for DT Debates
	1. Donald Trump lead a coup against the United States.
	2. You must acknowledge that Fox News knowingly told you the exact same lies that Donald Trump tried to tell state election boards, his officers in government, and his voter base/supporters? Every single person at Fox News knew very early on that every single Sydney Powel and Rudy Giuliani claim was utterly bullshit, so much so that they were pre-emptively removing them from shows and confronting them on their lack of evidence.
	3. The Supreme Court granted Trump immunity to escape criminal charges, they tossed part of the 14th amendment, the Republicans in the Supreme Court didn't convict because he was out of office, and he pardons all of his friends. There is no accountability. Why didn't he pardon those on J6?

Regarding the pearl clutching responses to the anti-civility tact you're currently taking, you might take a look at Frederick Douglas' "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" Douglas refuses to argue the merits/demerits of slavery in the speech-opting to merely ridicule the other side, asserting that what we need now is not more light, but fire. My point is that it scorn, ridicule, and vitriol is a deeply embedded in American discourse, and you're currently participating in a rich American tradition.
