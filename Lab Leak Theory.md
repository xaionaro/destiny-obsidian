# Purpose
Even today, there remains this pervasive theory that “conspiracy theorists were right” (JOE ROGAN CLIP and more?) about most of the baseless theories they propagated along the alternative (and mainstream) media networks over the past decade. There are many surrounding COVID and the vaccines, but some are so pervasive that even the left has largely bought into them. I don’t believe there is any theory that has a greater divide between “what is likely true” and “what do most people believe to be true” as the origin theory for SARS-CoV-2.
# Thesis
When one accounts for all of the information available, one can say with a high degree of probability that SARS-CoV-2’s first appearance in humans was due to zoonotic spillover at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China. All of the available evidence points **heavily** in that direction, and the only convincing evidence against it simply relies on a lack of knowledge about particular facts or education on the part of the listener with regards to how SARS-CoV-2 works.

The reality is, when one steps the heavy politically polluted framing from this question, the origination of SARS-CoV-2 from the seafood market becomes painfully obvious.
1. The first known infections occurred in the Seafood market, and the pattern of infections spread from there quite predictably in the weeks that followed.
2. The Huanan Seafood Market is a likely location for such a spillover to occur as it contained the highest number of wild animal selling stalls in all of China.
3. Testing at the markets allows us to trace with a high degree of probability the exact stalls where the zoonotic spillover likely occurred.
4. The animals that were kept in this stall were not only theorized to function as host species for these coronaviruses, a scientist had literally taken a trip to exactly this seafood market to the exact stall where these animals were held over 6 years prior and warned about the possibility of a spillover event.
5. The animals brought to the Huanan Seafood Market were brought in from caves in South China (FACT CHECK SPECIFIC), an area that is a rich reservoir for the types of coronaviruses the infect humans.

The challenges for the lab leak theory are numerous, but the largest challenge for the lab leak theory is that there isn’t even a single lab leak theory. There are many competing theories, some of which are necessarily mutually exclusive of one another, so even getting lab leak proponents to narrate a coherent theory from start to finish is incredibly challenging.
1. None of the researchers at the WIV were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
	1. Not even past samples had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for any of the researchers working there.
2. There are pictures of them going out and eating prior to the start of the pandemic, **after** they would have certainly been infected, if they had been infected secretly without anyone knowing.
3. The WIV was a 12 mile distance from the HSM.
	1. How did they manage to not infect anyone along the way? And no one in their personal lives? Or anyone else they could have come into contact with once they’d left the lab and the seafood market?
# Background
## [SARS-CoV-2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9839213/)
### Naming
- SARS-CoV-2 stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
	- "Severe", meaning the virus' disease can be life-threatening.
	- "Acute", meaning the symptoms are sudden and worsen very quickly.
	- "Respiratory", meaning the virus replicates easiest in the respiratory system.
	- It is a part of the coronavirus (named due to the shape of the protruding, club-shaped spikes) group, which are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense (meaning they can be read by the host ribosomes), single-stranded RNA genome contained inside of a nucleocapsid. They range from 26-32 kilobases in size, one of the largest among RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2's gnome has about 29,903 nucleotide bases, or 29.9 kilobases.
- Taxonomy
	- Realm: Riboviria
		- Kingdom: Orthornavirae

### Structure and Genome
- Structure
	- Spherical shaped virion, with a diameter of 80-120 nm, maintained by four structural proteins.
		- Spike Protein (S) (128-160 kDa)
			- It is surrounded by spike proteins, which are trimers, each composed of 3, long molecular chains of more than 1,273 amino acid residues.
			- Each of these trimers are composed of three monomers, which are then broken down into two subunits, S1 and S2.
				- The S1 subunits main role is to bind SARS-CoV-2 to a host cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE-2.
					- ACE-2 is found in cells in the intestines, kidneys, testis, gallbladder and heart.
				- The part of the S1 subunit that binds to ACE2 is called the RBD, or Region Binding Domain, or, more specifically, a part of the RBD, called the RBM, or Receptor Binding Motif
			- Determines tropism of the virus, or which cells it can infect via binding.
			- Infected cells with S proteins on the surface can also infect neighboring cells via cell-cell fusion.
		- Membrane Protein (M)
			- Supports the viral envelope, contains small inclusions of the envelope protein. Determines the shape and size of the viral capsid.
			- Interaction of M and S is necessary to retain S protein in the ERGIC and its inclusion in newly created virions.
			- Binding of M and N stabilizes nucleocapsid as well as inner core of the virion and contributes to completion of virus assembly.
		- Envelope Protein (E) (8-12 kDa)
			- Small, integral protein anchored into the membrane. Modulates the process of virion release.
		- Nucleocapsid Protein (N)
			- Helically symmetrical nucleocapsid which is formed by a single-stranded genomic RNA coated by nucleocapsid protein.
			- Localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, and involved in the assembly and budding of viral particles.
- Genome
	- 26-32 kilobases in length.
		- 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16).
		- 4 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E, as described above).
		- 11 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c, and ORF10).
### Lifecycle
1. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into a host cell primarily by binding the RBD of the S1 subunit of the Spike protein to ACE2. Once receptor engagement has occurred, if the Spike protein has been previously cleaved by furin during viral synthesis, the S2' site will be exposed, allowing cleavage by TMPRSS2 at the cell surface.
	1. If the S1-S2 FCS has not already been cleaved during viral synthesis, it will have to wait for furin to cleave it before cleavage at S2' can happen.
	2. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can gain entrance into the cell by being absorbed into the endosomal compartment following ACE2-mediated endocytosis, where it is then cleaved by cathepsin L.
2. The conformational changes in the S2 subunit following S1 subunit dissociation allows for the insertion of the FP (fusion peptide) into the membrane of the cell, driving viral fusion.
3. Gemonic RNA, once inside the cell, is immediately recognized and translated by the cell's ribosome, creating polyproteins which then process non-structural proteins.
4. Formation of the double-membrane vesicles occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, creating a space in the cell for viral processing to begin.
5. Genomic sense RNA is converted into antisense form of genomic and subgenomic RNAs.
6. Antisense form is then converted back into the sense form of genomic and subgenomic RNAs.
7. Subgenomic mRNAs are translated in the ER into structural and accessory proteins.
8. Genomic RNA interacts with N protein, forming a nucleocapsid.
9. Nucleocapsid combines with structural proteins to form a virion.
10. The mature virion released from the cell by exocytosis.

## The Pandemic
### Origin
1. The first known cases of COVID-19 were detected in the city of Wuhan, a population 12,000,000 people metropolis in the Chinese province of Hubei.
2. On December 26th-27th, 2019, [[Dr. Zhang Jixian]] examined two patients (at the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine) with unusual CT scans and suspected them of having a SARS-like disease.
3. On December 30th, Wuhan hospitals posted an emergency notice concerning 27 patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, with at least some of these early cases appearing to be connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
4. On January 1st, HSM was sanitized (partly due to heavy interference from the Chinese government), with samples being collected afterwards.
5. On January 20th, 2020, the Chinese National Health Commission publicly confirmed COVID-19's spread to healthcare workers, and on the 23rd Wuhan entered lockdown.
6. From December 10th, 2019, to January 1st, 2020, approximately 200 people are known to have had onset of COVID, of which 62 or 63 were vendors at the market and others had known epidemiological connections to it.
#### First Cases
- December 8th, 2019, Mr. Chen or Wei Guixian, on December 10th, 2019?
	- LOOK UP STUDY
- The WHO identified 174 known cases in December of 2019, with 30 being vendors and 25 being visitors to the Huanan Seafood Market.
### Huanan Seafood Market
1. 1,200 employee market with 680 shops, located on the first story of a multistory building.
2. The market sold wild and exotic live animals, with some being imported from south China, where wild coronaviruses are prevalent.
	1. The market did not sell bats, the suspected species that would have been the carrier for the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, though animals sold from the market were imported from south China, where bats that almost certainly carried the progenitor are found.
#### Testing at the Market
1. HSM was closed on January 1st, with 515 environmental samples being collected that day, with 364 additional environmental samples being collected from January 12th to March 2nd. 457 more samples from animals were collected from January 18th to March 30th, but it is important to note that none of these animals were the animals originally present for the theoretically spillover event.
2. None of the 457 animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were taken from dead animals in cold storage, and only 16 came from animals that were even plausible SARS-CoV-2 carriers, with most samples being collected 2 months after HSM was closed.
3. The environmental samples tested from the market were clustered around a very specific location, pointing towards a particular zoonotic spillover site. That specific location was known to have had live animals and employees known to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
4. The two stores with the most positive samples were stores with wild animals. One in particular, stall 6:29, had live raccoon dogs, one of the species suspected to be the intermediary for SARS-CoV-2, and was specifically identified in 2014 as a potential location of a novel disease spillover by Dr. Edward Holmes.
5. 60 drains were sampled January 27th-29th, with four testing positive, including the drain in front of shop 6:29. Two weeks later the drains were tested, of the 17 drains sampled from February 9th-15th, only three were positive, again the one in front of shop 6:29 tested positive, and two downstream from it.
### Uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2
1. BANAL-20-52 is a sarbecovirus sampled in Laos from a bat dropping with 96.8% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2, closer than any ancestor we found for SARS-CoV-1.
	1. BANAL-20-52 is missing the FCS that SARS-CoV-2 has. Bat's typically transmit virus' from their fecal droppings, meaning an FCS would likely be harmful to the lifecycle of this virus if present in a bat.
2. Furin Cleavage Site
	1. Furin recognizes proteins with an amino acid sequence of RxxR, and especially RRxR.
	2. The CGGCGG sequence is not quite as odd as people think. There's no reason to really expect that the sequence could have evolved over time through chance verse being inserted naturally through other evolutionary means. The out-of-frame insertion also seems to cut against the idea that this was done in a laboratory.
3. ACE2 binding affinity
	1. SARS-CoV-2 does seem to bind best to human ACE2 receptors out of the 14 species studied.
	2. The second highest affinity studied, however, was for pangolin, which is similar to human ACE2.
## Project DEFUSE
### Origin
1. In 2018, EcoHealth Alliance submitted a grant request to DARPA for $14m for "Project DEFUSE."
	1. 3.5 year project on studying bat coronaviruses in collaboration with 5 other groups (University of North Carolina, Duke-National University Singapore, Wuhan Institute of Virology, USGS National Wildlife Health Center, and Palo Alto Research Group).
	2. This projected was ultimately not funded.
### Goals
1. Collect bat coronaviruses and perform computer and lab testing on them.
2. Add vaccines and immune boosting agents to wild bats.
3. Create an app for soldiers to determine likelihood of bats having dangerous diseases.

It's noteworthy that no genetic engineering was to be performed at WIV, nor would any chimeric viruses be transported there, except for prototype vaccines which use a raccoonpox chimera. WIV was to be involved with samples collected from bats, tests on bats, tests on people who live near bats, and experiments in bat caves.

Project DEFUSE was involved in studying a broad array of things related to coronaviruses and did not really lay out a precise blueprint for creating SARS-CoV-2. especially not in any singular research lab.

# The Case for Zoonotic Origin
## Challenging Questions for Lab Leakers
1. What is the explanation for a and b lineages both showing up for the very first time in the wet market?
	1. If it came from a lab, why two different variants?
2. There has never been a gain of function lab leak before, this would have to be the first one.
3. How do you explain the novel backbone used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
	1. It seems like the lab leak theory relies on a completely unpublished virus using some novel and unpredicted things, e.g. the FCS location and the particular RBD amino acids.
4. Why did the virus spread at the wet market first, when other origin sites would have made more sense?
5. The FCS add was added out of frame, using a leading residue that isn't typically used in experiments (SARS-CoV-2 has Proline or Alanine before the RxxR site).
6. Why are all of the earliest cases connected to the market? Why weren't early clusters surrounding the lab? Or in a mall or some other more densely populated place?
	1. FIND EXACT FIGURES
7. How do you explain easy, early mutations that appear in a single *in vivo* generation like D614G?
8. Why were Shi Zhengli and other scientists going out to eat in December and traveling if they thought they were infected by a lab-leaked virus?
9. Why did they even publish RaTG13, the closets coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2? Why is it only 96% similar?
	1. This was published after SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced.
10. Why haven't there been more SARS-CoV-2 leaks since so many new labs are working on it now, with even more infectious strains?
11. Why did the sampling in the HSM bias where the raccoon dogs were found?
12. Why did no retroactive samples show SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring prior to the earliest cases detected at the HSM?
	1. ZO debate 1, slide 116 - Wuhan, Baidu data shows very little signal for symptoms of a circulating coronavirus prior to December
	2. ZO debate 1, slide 114 - Wuhan, 3850 blood bank samples from Sep-Dec 2019 show no positives for antibodies
	3. ZO debate 1, slide 113 - Wuhan, 640 throat swabs Oct 6th - Jan 21st 2020. No positives in 2019, 9 in 2020.
	4. ZO debate 1, slide 112 - WHO report data with hundreds of influenza like illness samples and no positives in 2019 from Hubei and Wuhan.
	5. ZO debate 1, slide 110/111 - Wuhan excess mortality in early 202, no Hubei excess mortality signal until 2020 (and it’s very small)
	6. ZO debate 1, slide 109 - Wuhan, no uptick in hospitalizations until December 2019.
	7. ZO debate 1, slide 106 - WHO report, followed up on 92 ILI cases later, could find only 67, none with antibodies.
## For Lab-Leak to be True
1. Project DEFUSE research was started, even though the grant was declined.
2. The research exclusively happened in WIV, despite project DEFUSE being a collaborative effort of multiple research groups involved, with many important components happening at the University of North Carolina.
3. The research discovered (and leaked) SARS-CoV-2 very quickly, as project DEFUSE research was planned to take 3.5 years to complete.
4. A secret viral backbone needs to have been discovered (found and sampled from a wild animal) and experimented with.
5. Project DEFUSE specifies using viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-1 (80% similarity to SARS-CoV-2).
6. Optimal RBD amino acids not predicted by computer models would have had to have been discovered via the creation of this novel virus, without running into other obvious mutations (D614G, and N501Y)
7. No one at the lab ever tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the initial outbreak according to the 2021 WHO report, and there were no turnover of staff in the coronavirus team.
	1. The reserved sera in April 2019 and March 2020 from all the workers and students in research group led by Professor Shi Zhengli were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
## False Assertions by Lab Leakers
1. The distance from the lab is not 1 mile, it's more like 12 miles.
2. SARS' spill-over animal was not found. Most exact spill-overs were not found.
