# Background
- COVID-19 is a disease caused SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, originating from Wuhan, China.
- The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 8th of 2019.
# Basic Microbiology
- [Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22M2Wh6rQmA) of the spike protein/cleavage site stuff
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nD6Q9X0SFw) that partially explains how the mRNA vaccines work
# Current Research
- [The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2](The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2), published in Nature
	- The researchers in this early paper argue that parallel demonstrations of 6 key amino acids in the RBD being present in other similar hosts in Wuhan, in a configuration that was not predicted to be optimal for infection (for binding via ACE2), suggest a common ancestor for the virus.
	- They also argue that the acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site suggests natural selection occurred over many generations within the presence of an active immune system, which is unlikely to happen in a laboratory setting, especially with no evidence or documentation of any attempt with a particular nucleotide sequence (virus) to do so.

# The Rootclaim debate
- Saar Wilf is an ex-Israeli entrepreneur multi-millionaire who claims to have invented a system of analysis called Rootclaim where he takes bets against predictions made by his system.
- Peter Miller [took him up on a debate challenge](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-kavanaugh-on-fideism/comment/12792183) in 2024 concerning his prediction that COVID-19 originated in a lab.
## The Debate
- [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1vaooTKHCM)
	- In favor of zoonotic
		- Prior transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses have happened from animals to humans before.
		- Seasonally, it's likely that SARS-CoV-2 came in the Winter season, as they often do (due to bat breeding cycles).
		- Range of bats isn't relevant, based on prior catalogued coronavirus'.
		- The origination of the virus was ~30 minutes from the lab, from the 9th largest city in China.
		- There has never been a gain of function lab leak.
		- Lots of evidence of it being in the market, not much showing up between the lab and the market.
		- There are a multitude of "lab leak theories", many of which are contradicting in both timelines and facts
		- 4/5 of the first infected people were all associated with the Wuhan markets.
		- Markets wouldn't be the best place for a superspreading event, something like a mall would be, purely when analyzing by traffic.
		- Market is genetically closest to the origination point of SARS-CoV-2.
		- China removed signs in the wet market related to the sale of wild animals for consumption.
