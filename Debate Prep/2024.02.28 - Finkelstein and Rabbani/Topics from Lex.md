- Beginning statement
	- Goal: The goal today is not for anyone to win arguments, but to together explore the history, present, and future of Israel and Palestine… and human civilization broadly.
		- Agree & solutions: I would love to find places we agree, and places that give an inkling of hope for a solution in the future.
	- Respect: I ask that we show respect and compassion toward each other.
	- Basics: I also ask that we try to briefly define/explain terms, events, people when we discuss them, for folks in the audience that are not as familiar with the topic.
	- Time: I will do my best to allocate time equally between two sides of the table, but I would also love for this to be a free-flowing conversation.
- Opening question - 1948: First question is about 1948. For Israelis, 1948 is the establishment of the state of Israel and the war of independence. For Palestinians, 1948 is the Nakba, catastrophe, or the expulsion or flight of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes as a consequence of the war. What to you is important to understand about 1948?
	- Order of response to first question is: Norm, Benny, Mouin, and Steven
