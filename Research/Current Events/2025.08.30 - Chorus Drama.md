# Taylor Lorenz Article
- "[A Dark Money Group Is Secretly Funding High-Profile Democratic Influencers](https://www.wired.com/story/dark-money-group-secret-funding-democrat-influencers/)" August 27th, 2025 ([August 27th archive](https://archive.ph/sSVgV)) by Taylor Lorenz
	- [August 29th archive](https://archive.ph/O0Lxc#selection-699.0-699.74) with revisions made on August 28th.
		- There are some comments by Wilson added in parenthesis after some statements, though it appears that all of the original text and claims remains unchanged.
## Claims from the Article
*Evaluating the statements Lorenz makes about Chorus, whether they're good, neutral, or bad, and then the truth value of said statements.*
1. Good
2. Neutral
	1. Creators are being paid $8,000/month.
	2. Creators have an obligation to have messaging check-ins and to attend two "newsroom" events per month.
3. Bad
	1. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) Mentions multiple times that the program is "secretive" and mandates "extensive secrecy" about payment disclosure.
		1. Chorus seems to be openly and publicly spoken about, both on the website itself and by several content creators. I'm not sure what is supposed to be secretive?
		2. BTC disagrees with this as well in his Twitter video.
	2. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) Claims that the Chorus contract restricted signees from doing certain political content.
		1. Allie O'Brien claims that you can be critical of the Dems or their policy agendas if you want, and shows examples of her doing such.
		2. David Pakman denies all of these claims as well.
		3. BTC disagrees with this as well in his Twitter video.
	3. (<span style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0);font-weight:bold">True</span>)Lots of "Dark Money Group" mentions in relation to the Sixteen Thirty Fund.
	4. A lot of talk about restrictions from the contract that *seem* to be bad, such as:
		1. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) creators not being allowed to acknowledge the existence of the program
			1. Allie O'Brien claims you can make public statements about Chorus. with written consent.
			2. BTC disagrees with this as well in his Twitter video.
		2. (**Irrelevant**) their part in the program (without prior written consent)
			1. This seems to be true, but not really a big deal.
		3. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) receiving payments from the program
			1. Allie O'Brien and David Pakman, as well as others, seem to publicly state they are in the program, and imply there is some payments received.
			2. BTC disagrees with this as well in his Twitter video.
		4. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) being prohibited from organizing independently their own lawmaker engagements
			1. Allie O'Brien's contract paste seems to indicate that you can indeed arrange your own interviews/other content with political figures, you simply need to notify Chorus of this agreement. She provides a lot of emails/business cards/evidence confirming as much.
		5. (**Irrelevant**) giving Chorus the ability to remove or correct content made by Creators at any Chorus-organized event.
			1. This could be true, but is totally standard for anyone that runs events.
			2. BTC disagrees with this as well in his Twitter video.
	5. (**Irrelevant**) A leaked Zoom call with Graham Wilson claims members won't have to worry about FEC disclosures or public disclaimers.
	6. (**Irrelevant**) A quote from Elizabeth Dubois saying the legal aspect of the organization is "murky."
	7. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) A quote from Don Heider claiming "if the contract says you can't disclose money, it is unethical."
		1. Allie O'Brien clarifies in her video that Chorus does not pay people to create any content individually/explicitly, so there is no need for disclosures as would ordinarily be legally required.
	8. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) One Creator claimed they were denied the ability to red-line the contract.
	9. (**Irrelevant**) The article lists many times of influencers who are working with or accepted a contract with Chorus, including six creators who were involved a weekly series titled "Good News in Politics." It also names two creators who defended Chorus through a prior drama relating to utilizing people's images without permission for fundraising purposes.
	10. (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);font-weight:bold">False</span>) There's a claim about a non-disparagement clause that makes it seem as though it is out of the ordinary or overly burdensome.

Verdict: This is a hit-piece, with the goal of attacking/destroying the Chorus organization and destroying the reputation of anyone who touches it or defends it, and sending a signal/message that anyone involved with it in the future will be similarly targeted. It's not even clear from reading this article what Chorus is. Do they pay creators to make content? Do they just try to synchronize messaging? Do they dictate to creators the subject matter they must cover? What are creators even being compensated for?
## Contradictions
*These statements exist in the article, but they're seemingly contradictory and no resolution for them is given in the article.*
1. There is a quote from Elizabeth Dubois claiming that these groups can be used to evade spending limits from individual creators, but the article also claims that creators in the program can't use funds from the program to support or oppose any political candidate.
2. Lorenz writes that Republicans have spent decades building an independent media infrastructure, but it sounds like she's describing a highly interdependent and integrated independent media apparatus that works directly with the Republican Party. She also claims that Chorus highlights a difference between Democrats and Republicans, claiming that Chorus' attempts to build an online media ecosystem are somehow the opposite of what the Republicans have done, but doesn't seem to explain how?
3. In the article, there is an anonymous creator who claims he was specifically told his lawyer could not red-line a contract, yet the article opens with a bunch of creators speaking about red-lining their contracts. Why were some allowed and others weren't?
4. Lorenz claims a copy of the contract forbade creators from independently organizing their own content with lawmakers/political leaders, but also says they have an obligation to inform Chorus of said independently organized events. How can both of these be true at once?
5. The first paragraph of the article heavily implies, if not out-right states, that every member of Chorus is making $8,000 per month. Later on the, article goes into different "tiers" and explains some might have been offered as little as $250 per month. The tagline implies it's not all the same, but the opening paragraph is ambiguous.
## Prescriptions
- There's a quote/claim by V Spehar, saying that funding from middleman groups is bad and that funding should go to creators directly. How? How is that different from just watching streams/YouTubes? How does that address at all the issues with a lack of coherence and cohesion with Democrat Party messaging?

# Important Notes
1. According to an [announcement](https://omidyar.com/update/omidyar-network-announces-sixth-class-of-reporters-in-residence/) by Omidyar Network, Lorenz herself is a recipient of "dark money" for her journalistic activities, and she gets paid $8,000/month as well. This Omidyar Network group also receives money from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, according to their [2022 990](https://www.sixteenthirtyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sixteen-Thirty-Fund-2022-Public-Disclosure-Copy.pdf)
