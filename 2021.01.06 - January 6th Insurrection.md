## Undermining The Electoral Process
Donald Trump made statements about the election being rigged even prior to his 2016 election, and continually called for the complete and total ban on mail-in ballots. ABC News [catalogued](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-things-rigged-rigged/story?id=42738506) a lot of the false election claims, and I've included some below.
### Foreknowledge of Disparate Attitudes Towards Mail-in Voting
10 states [allowed](https://ballotpedia.org/Early_voting_dates,_2020) early voting via mail as early as September for the 2020 election. Donald Trump was making multiple claims of voter fraud via mail-in ballots, which Democrats [were known](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/11/20/the-voting-experience-in-2020/) to utilize in greater numbers than Republicans, despite Trump having absolutely no evidence of said voter fraud and despite  counting having not even yet begun and no numbers being published. 

>[!quote]- [*Dominion v Fox News*](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dominion-Complaint-Fox.pdf) pages 18-19
> Not surprisingly, given these trends, the head of the Fox News Decision Desk correctly predicted that “on election night, we may be looking at states where it seems that President Trump is in the lead, but there’s still 20 or 30 percent of the vote outstanding … so we’re not [going to be] able to make the call in those states." He correctly recognized—and Fox widely and repeatedly reported before the election—that this would occur because President Trump had criticized mail-in voting and encouraged Republicans to vote in person whereas Democrats had encouraged their supporters to vote by mail. In fact, Maria Bartiromo discussed this very phenomenon with President Trump in an October 11, 2020 interview, with President Trump lamenting that mail-in votes would likely be counted “two weeks after the vote comes in,” and stating that “Republicans are going out to vote—they don’t want to do the [mail-in] ballot thing, they don’t trust it. Republicans are going out to vote.”

Fox News was also complicit in the process, helping Trump fabricate and prepare to push lies in the event that he lost the election.

>[!quote]- The Daily Beast, [*Fox News Pushes ‘Brain Room’ to Find Evidence for Trump’s Voter Fraud Claims, Insiders Say*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-pushing-brain-room-to-lend-credibility-to-trumps-voter-fraud-paranoia-insiders-say) on October 31st, 2020
> “Officially, it looks like an attempt to report on election irregularities. What it feels like is an attempt to push more baseless conspiracy theories and scare the viewers into thinking the election is being ‘stolen.’ It isn’t,” one Fox News veteran with direct knowledge of the Election Integrity Project, told The Daily Beast. “It’s alarming that the Brain Room is a part of this, like it’s an attempt to give it an air of legitimacy. I don’t recall ever seeing anything like this before.”
> 
> This person added: “It feels like an attempt to use the Brain Room to try to lend credibility to something that isn’t credible. It feels like a stunt to support Trump’s baseless allegations that the Democrats are trying to ‘steal’ the election. If it is a collection or database of alleged voter fraud examples, I could see it being used to support Trump’s efforts to contest the election results, if Biden wins.”
> 
> A second Fox News staffer—who, like other current employees quoted in this story, asked not to be further identified for fear of retaliation—said the Election Integrity Project “seems a logical effort to collect information about mail-in ballots that could skew the results… Fox clearly wants to portray mailed-in ballots in the most negative light, since Democrats favor it and Trump’s re-election, if polls are to be believed this time around, is not at all a foregone conclusion. He and GOP leaders are promoting doubt about the system, which arguably has its flaws, and of course Fox serves as a force multiplier to their narratives.”

Some politicians, like Bernie Sanders, literally [predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LIb7xNL9Sc) (on October 23rd, 2020) the exact outcome of election night because it was already known that mail-in ballots might take a bit longer to count and they would likely dramatically favor Democrats. Sanders even predicted Trump trying to end the voting early.

 A [leaked audio recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxNoUnxN_cs) from October 31st, 2020, of Steve Bannon shows him speaking about Trump's plan to call the election early.
### 2012 Election
- On November 6th, 2012, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266034630820507648) that people should "march on Washington" to protest the election results. A few minutes later, he [claimed](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266035509162303492) that America "is not a democracy."
### 2016 Election
- In February 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rM9lYDwseo) that Ted Cruz's campaign rigged the Iowa Caucus.
- On April 16th, 2016, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/721307257472999424) that the Republican primaries were rigged and boss controlled. On that [appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mk2M3-MCQw) that he references, he goes on to speak about how delegates are just bribed and paid off to vote for certain candidates.
- On August 1st, 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU3z7iFIalY&t=440s) the last election in 2012 was rigged, and claims with certainty that the 2016 election on November 8th is going to be rigged, and that Republicans "better be careful."
- In October 2016, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video) they were trying to rig the election at the polling booths, saying dead people were voting, illegal immigrants were voting, and that they were fighting in a rigged election.
- On November 27th, 2016, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664) that he would have won the popular vote against Hillary "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."

From May 11th, 2017 to January 3rd, 2018, Trump created the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity, also known as the Voter Fraud Commission. It requested an unusually invasive amount of voter data from the states, but all 50 states refused to comply. After Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed a lawsuit against the Republican members of the Commission for not sharing documents or scheduling information, the commission was disbanded by Trump. The Commission was not able to find any evidence of voter fraud.
### 2020 Election
- On April 7th, 2020, Donald Trump [claims](https://x.com/MSNBC/status/1247658663617138691) that there is voter fraud in the form of people filling out multiple ballots and dumping ballots for Trump, after claiming mail-in voting was okay when he did it, but not when other people do it.
- On May 20th, 2024, Donald Trump [answered](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-governor-hutchinson-arkansas-governor-kelly-kansas/) in a press briefing that "thousands and thousands" of mail-in ballots were fraudulently filled out.
- On May 24th, 2020, Donald Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264558926021959680) that the United States "cannot have Mail in Ballots," saying it would be the "greatest Rigged Election in history."
- On August 24th, 2020, Donald trump [states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWVVDKK3H8&t=1255s) that the only way they can lose the election is if it's rigged and someone takes it from us.
- On September 23rd, 2020, Donald Trump [would not commit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR8oIitE6mI) to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming that the mail-in ballots were fraudulent and out of control.
- On September 29th, 2020, Donald Trump [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHysqu3gnSc&t=180s) that mail-in ballots being sent out pre-emptively were all fraudulently done by the Democrats, and that Americans were going to see a "fraud like you've never seen." He also claims that "we won't know for months" for the counting of the mail-in ballots.

Trump fluidly switched between definitions when he claimed the election was "rigged," meaning it could be officials rigging polls, ballot boxes being stuffed, ballots being not counted, boxes being tossed, vote totals being changed, etc...etc...

It's important to note that while Donald Trump claims ahead of time that voter fraud would be rampant in 2020, he never actually gives a way to make mail-in ballots more secure, he simply advocates for the elimination of them altogether, repeatedly, because he knows they will favor Democratic voters. 

Donald Trump attempted to call the election early, on the night of, despite [everyone across the nation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/01/why-itll-be-normal-if-results-shift-in-the-days-after-the-election) knowing it would take some time to count the incoming mail-in ballots. He also falsely claimed he won many states by margins that were impossible to be overcome, despite it having been completely untrue, and continues to call the mail-in ballots fraudulent, claiming that he already won the election. On November 5th, the next morning, he went as far as to [tweet](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324353932022480896) "STOP THE COUNT!" so he wouldn't lose his majority.
### *Dominion v. Fox News*
In June of 2021, Dominion filed a complaint against Fox News, alleging that the company engaged in a widespread campaign of defamatory behavior towards Dominion in order to salvage its reputation among conservative media listeners. Dominion's lawsuit accused Fox of lying on four separate claims:
1. Dominion committed election fraud by rigging the 2020 Presidential Election
2. Dominion’s software and algorithms manipulated vote counts in the 2020 Presidential Election
3. Dominion is owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for the dictator Hugo Chávez; and
4. Dominion paid kickbacks to government officials who used its machines in the 2020 Presidential Election.

Factual Allegations
- Dominion was established in 2002 by CEO John Poulos and procured its first contract with New York state in July 2009. 
- After it became clear that Trump would lose into the election, on November 6th, Donald Trump began to complain that his lead had "mysteriously disappeared."
- On November 7th, Fox projected Trump had lost the election.
- On November 8th, Fox invited Sidney Powell onto the *Sunday Morning Futures* show to discuss Dominion voting fraud.
	- Powell declared that there was “a massive and coordinated effort to steal this election from We the People of the United States of America, to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, to manufacture votes for Joe Biden.” 
- ...more to the [complaint](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dominion-Complaint-Fox.pdf), I don't have time to read through all of this right now, though.

Dominion's [motion for summary judgement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23731963-dominion_3-21-23_hearing_slides-used-at-hearing_redacted) contains many damming emails showing that Fox News was knowingly capitalizing on fraudulent election claims to win back their audience after election night

## Election Night
The election occurred on November 3rd and went as everyone predicted, with Donald Trump initially having a large lead and then slowly losing it as mail-in ballots were counted as the night progressed.

At 11:20 PM, Fox News [called Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/us/politics/trump-fox-news-arizona.html) for Joe Biden, sending Donald Trump and his team into a fury. Jason Miller [tweeted out](https://x.com/JasonMillerinDC/status/1323849305917186050), admonishing Fox News for calling the election early. Jared Kushner was also in contact with Rupert Murdoch as the night went on. At 2:30 AM the following morning, Trump told supports "this is a fraud on the American public,”

Rupert Murdoch, January 20th, 2021.
The more I think about McConnell's remarks or complaint the more I agree.

Trump insisting on the election being stolen and convincing 251 of Americans was a huge
disservice to the country. Pretty much a crime. Inevitable it blew up Jan 6th

Best we don't mention his name unless essential and certainly don't support him.
We have to respect people of principle and if it comes to the Senate don't take sides.

I know he is being over demonized, but he brought it on himself.
