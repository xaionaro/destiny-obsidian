norm debate
- benny signed off on 99% of what I said

"Regime change" so it could end up like what, Iraq? Libya? Iran? Yemen?
We shouldn't have overthrown Assad? Nor Saddam? Nor Gadaffi? But Israel, yes?

What would be done about another future potential genocide?
Is one likely to occur?

Should funding to Palestine be conditional?




RHETORICAL STRATEGIES
- CALL OUT NAME CALLING
- CALL OUT BAD FAITH STRATEGIES
	- "Twisting things"
	- "Debate bro"
	- "getting into the weeds"
- CAN YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT I'VE JUST SAID
- "THERE'S A LOT OF NUANCE"
