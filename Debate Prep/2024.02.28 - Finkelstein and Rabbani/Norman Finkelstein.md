Why is Hamas bad?
- Not democratically elected. Coup'd Fatah, no elections.
- Transmits propaganda to children.
- Inhibits any peace process, they just want war. Remember the fighting with Abbas when he wanted truce in 2005.
- Utilize human shields. Even IC recognizes this.
- Hoards and diverts money from humanitarian places. Digging up pipes, stealing money, hoarding food.
- Digs tunnels, fires rockets constantly.
Questions for Norm
- Does Hamas have a moral justification for terrorism against Isralies?
- Are their actions taking Palestine closer to or further from peace?
- How should Israel respond to Hamas?
- Why does Israel have the blockade?
- Why didn't Egypt or Jordan make a Palestinian state in '48?
- Do you have any criticisms at all for Hamas?
- Is getting rid of Hamas a worthy goal?
- Do you support a one state or two state solution?
- Why doesn't the IDF "mow the lawn" in the West Bank?
- Why do you say consensus says blockade illegal but only cite one footnote in chapter 4 of Method and Madness.
- Why do you describe the Turkel report as Quasi-Official?

# [Israel-Hamas War: Norman Finkelstein vs Rabbi Shmuley | Full Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx_qCu7jF9U)
- "Israel is plausibly committing genocide by the ICJ."
- Finkelstein has no concern for the Charlie Hebdo victims???
- "The intensity of the bombing, the density of the bombing, the magnitude with destruction of civilian infrastructure, the absolute number of children killed, the relative number of children killed to combatants killed, the percentage of women and children killed, the number of medical personnel and journalists killed"...Israel's assault on Gaza, this is why they were brought before the ICJ.
