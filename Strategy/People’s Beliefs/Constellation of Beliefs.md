Rather than starting from some epistemically humble foundation and individually constructing beliefs, people inherit constellations of beliefs from the social groups they find themselves in, often due to [[Social Incentives Dictate Beliefs|social pressures]] that push them towards these belief systems.. These constellations of beliefs will share some similar, hollow chains of logic, but they are ultimately absorbed at the “applied” level for most people and often have little to no thought put into them before they’re accepted as a person’s own beliefs. These beliefs are always somewhat abstract as well, meaning there is no immediate corrective mechanism that exists in the real world to counter them, as they always make claims that are either just out of our ability to directly perceive them or will come at some point in the future (though they rarely, if ever, manifest).

Here is an example from 2024: 
- The “anti-establishment” constellation
	- Supports Donald Trump
	- Believe Donald Trump is being unfairly prosecuted
	- Believes in the “elite” ruling class
	- Thinks the 2020 election was stolen
	- Doesn’t trust any of the mainstream media
	- Doesn’t trust the vaccine
	- Thinks COVID was largely overblown and all forms of lockdown were unnecessary
	- Supported Brexit
	- Doesn’t trust most US Institutions, especially intelligence agencies or anything related to healthcare
	- Believes Andrew Tate is being unfairly targeted
	- Opposes most “woke” coded things, e.g. transgenderism, affirmative action, feminism, etc…

Evidence of the existence of these constellations is supported by the following:
1. High degree of congruency between many people who are part of these constellations.
2. High likelihood that a person possessing a single belief in this constellation will possess many of the others.
3. Parts of the constellation appear to be highly contradictory to each other.
4. “Webbing” - when someone hears that you have a belief that’s part of another constellation they’re aware of, they will instantly assume that you have a plethora of other beliefs immediately, since they are projecting their own adherence to a constellation onto you.

It becomes incredibly difficult to break anyone out of any given constellation because there is always some underlying transcendental entity that can explain every single part of why the constellation is true. Even evidence that seems to be in opposition to any particular belief is reinterpreted through the transcendental entity and becomes evidence for the particular belief.

Examples of this in relation to the earlier anti-establishment constellation:
- ”I don’t trust the mainstream media, but the New York Post was just an example of someone trying to do the right thing for once!”
- “I don’t trust any part of our government, and Donald Trump isn’t technically a part of the government! That’s why they hate him so much, because even though he’s the president he’s not like them!“
- “I don’t believe anything the intelligence agencies say, except for when they say things that I agree with, like when some say COVID probably came from a lab!”
- “I never trust special investigators, like Mueller, but I do trust some like Durham, but I definitely don’t trust people like Comey when he refused to press charges against HIllary, but I definitely did trust him when he gave that scathing review of her email use!”
- “Donald Trump is an amazing leader, it’s not his fault every person he nominated or worked with ended up backstabbing him! He’s such a good leader that they had to come together like never before to stop him!”
- “The election was rigged, even though Trump’s own nominated lawyers, campaign managers and white house staff said otherwise, and it was only rigged in the states he lost, even if the means to rig it were done months ahead of the actual election and went completely unchallenged!”
