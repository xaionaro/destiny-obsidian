# Location
[[Iran]]
# Causes
- Persia initially declared its neutrality at the outset of World War I, but other great powers had competing interests in the region.
	- Britain and Russia agreed to divide Persia into three regions as per the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]], with Russia laying claim to the north and Britain claiming the south bordering India.
	- The German Empire, via their [[Intelligence Bureau for the East]], promoted subversive, nationalist agitations in British India, Persia and Egypt in order to fight against the Anglo-Russian alliance.
	- The Ottoman Empire wanted to cut off Russian access to oil found in the [[Caspian Sea]]
		- [[Enver Pasha]] also saw the possibility of gaining access to [[Azerbaijan]], Central Asia and to [[India]], with the goal of expanding cooperation between these newly establishing states for his dreams of a pan-Turanian project.
# Events
- Persia did not have a single, unified army, but rather each district furnished its own battalion of troops, often irregular in nature and with no unified, formal training.
- In the course of World War I, all of the great powers deployed armies into and fought over lands in Persia.
# Outcome
- The British would issue the [[Anglo-Persian Agreement]] to Persia, giving drilling rights to the British Anglo-Persian Oil Company in August 1919, though it would dissolve a couple of years later on June 22nd, 1921, having never been ratified by the Majilis.
# Important Notes
- While Persia wasnâ€™t of great importance during WWI, conquest by British and Russia, especially with regards to the 1908 discovery of oil in Persia, would set the stage for later conflict.
