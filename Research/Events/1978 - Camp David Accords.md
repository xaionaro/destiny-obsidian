# Location
# Causes
- Carter Initiative
	- Carter's goal was to rejuvenate the Middle East peace process.
	- The Egyptians and Israelis secretly worked towards bilateral talks.
# Facts
- Participating Parties
	- Carter met with Sadat of Egypt, Hussein of Jordan, Hafez al-Assad of Syria, and Rabin of Israel. Only Sadat and Rabin were interested in negotiations.
- Sadat Initiative
	- Sadat seemed eager to make peace with Israel, even traveling to Jerusalem and speaking in front of the Knesset about potential peace.
	- Egypt wanted to secure a future more in line with its own interests, rather than fixating on being part of the broader Arab collection of countries. There was also a belief that a bilateral peace agreement with Israel would cause a cascade of other peace agreements to happen in following.

>By pushing Palestine to the forefront of the struggle against the Jewish state, Nasser radically changed the parameters of the conflict. Now it was no longer just a border dispute between sovereign states, and one that was susceptible to a rational solution, but a conflict of an almost mythological nature over the plight of the Palestinians and their ‘inalienable’ rights, where hardly any room for compromise could exist. It is from this perspective that Sadat’s peace initiative, in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, needs to be understood. To make peace he needed to extricate Egypt’s conflict with Israel from the paralysing hold of the Palestinian dilemma into which Nasser had locked it and bring it back to the realm of rationality as a solvable border dispute between two sovereign states.
- Egyptian-Israeli talks
	- Carter pushed both leaders in Camp David for a broad peace agreement between the two.
- Partial agreements
	- The first part of the agreement focused on UN Resolution 242.
		- Wanted to establish self-governing authorities in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
		- Deliberately left out talks about Jerusalem, and neglected the Golan Heights, Syria or Lebanon.
	- The second part of the agreement dealt with Egyptian-Israeli relations.
	- A 5 year plan was given to have the West Bank and Gaza rule themselves autonomously. Again, Jerusalem was not mentioned nor was the Palestinian Right of Return.
- UN Rejection
	- The UN General Assembly rejected the Framework for Peace in the Middle East due to lack of participation of the UN and PLO. It did not comply with the Palestinian right of return, of self-determination and to national independence and soverignty.
	- The part of the Camp David accords regarding the Palestinian future and all similar ones were declared invalid.
# Outcome
- The Palestinian [[National Guidance Committee]] formed in response to the Camp David Accords.
