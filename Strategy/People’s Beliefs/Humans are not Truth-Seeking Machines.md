Humans treat truth as instrumental, meaning it is a tool to be utilized to further someone's personal happiness. When the tool is no longer serving that purpose, it will be abandoned in favor of another tool. In certain domains, especially relating to science, engineering and medicine, “truth” most likely needs to adhere pretty closely to reality for the truth to yield any tangible benefit. It’s not very beneficial for one to believe drinking mercury will cure their disease nor pouring gasoline onto a candle will extinguish the flame, so these beliefs are quickly and immediately dispelled in favor of something that more accurately approaches what is actually true.

It’s important to recognize this because humans who believe their senses naturally and intuitively lead them to “truthful” things rather than “pleasurable” things are likely to confuse the two when there is [[Social Incentives Dictate Beliefs|incentive]] to believe the truth about a thing. Without any immediate mechanisms to align “truth” with “reality", people's understandings can wildly diverge from reality in fantastic ways that lead to catastrophic consequences down the road. Examples of things might be things like vaccine skepticism, climate change denialism, or the mistrust of our voting process. Since these [[Constellation of Beliefs|beliefs inherited from our social groups]] lack any immediately corrective mechanisms, it’s easy for them to fester and manifest in long term negative ways.
